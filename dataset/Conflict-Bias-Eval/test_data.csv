The Israeli military base is so distant from populated areas.. again, been there done that.. whatâs funny is that you say that about Israel and donât talk about the Hamas base under Shifa hospital.. yep.. lies and hypocrisy..

Then what can you say about the Nahal settlements? Also funny you believe there's a command base under al-Shifa which was something that got completely disproven by investigation and expert opinion its sad to see people still believing such thing.

&gt;After that you just repeat your lies and bullshit I said from the start that the pro Palestinian movement believes in.. amazing we give Gaza aid and food Hamas steals that and then âIsrael is starving the Palestinian peopleâð¤¦ð»ââï¸ you want us maybe to go and feed them with a spoon?

That's a pretty hateful and an unnecessary comment since I provided proof for my claims and you just keep replying to them stating they're bs

And no The Aid is barely passing to Gaza via the northern entrances due to the Israeli settlers blocking those trucks have you been blinding yourself with the lies?  
And maybe protests can MAYBE result in the US pressuring Israel to take actions against such people?

At least 40 Hamas operatives have been killed by Israeli troops in Gaza Cityâs Shejaiya neighborhood amid a new pinpoint raid there, according to fresh IDF assessments.

The number refers to those the IDF was able to identify following battles. More terror operatives were likely killed in strikes against buildings and tunnels, the army has assessed.

The operation in Shejaiya, launched on Thursday, came after the IDF said it identified Hamas operatives regrouping in the area, as well as new intelligence on the terror groupâs infrastructure.

The raid is being carried out by the 98th Division with two brigades: the 7th Armored Brigade and Paratroopers Brigade.

The IDF first operated in Shejaiya during the initial months of the ground offensive against Hamas, announcing that it had dismantled the terror groupâs local battalion there in December. It last returned to the Gaza City neighborhood in April, as the military shifted its operations in the Strip to intelligence-based targeted raids.

According to military assessments, surviving Hamas operatives in northern Gaza have been able to regroup in Shejaiya, as well as recruit new members to the terror group.

In the latest operation in Shejaiya, the IDF says it has been able to reach previously undiscovered tunnel networks and Hamas sites, using new intelligence obtained during other operations in Gaza. Many tunnels were demolished in the initial offensive in the neighborhood, but not all were discovered at the time.

The latest operation began on Thursday with a raid against a school complex in Shejaiya that had been turned into a âcombat complexâ by Hamas operatives, according to the military. The IDF said troops reached the complex within 40 minutes and found a long-range rocket launcher in the area. The site was in an area the army had not reached in previous operations in Shejaiya.

The raid against the school has provided the IDF with valuable intelligence on Hamas activities, military officials say.

Troops are also encountering relatively fierce resistance in Shejaiya, with dozens of attacks, including RPG fire, explosive devices, and sniper attacks, as well as some close-quarters combat.

Two soldiers were killed and another two were seriously wounded in separate incidents in Shejaiya over the weekend.

The army expects the operation in Shejaiya to not take longer than a few weeks, similar to other pinpoint raids in the northern Gaza Strip that have been carried out in recent months.

As an American I can tell you literally no one I know falls for the audio leaks that feature ""cartoon villain"" sounding men speaking to each other in an accent that is easily discernable as non native Palestinian Arabic. The IDF really loses credibility whenever they drop these fake clips because it makes you wonder how much time they spend generating them. The hilarious part is these audio calls always feature two ""Hamas terrorists"" who provide a very accurate commentary to each other on cellphone that confirms the IDF narrative. Lmfao I mean the dude goes on to even say ""Yes Abu Rafik it was out fault they hit our truck of ammo and there were bags of money that were burning"" even though no such burnt currency is seen anywhere on sight. This is why I've stopped viewing IDF press releases they have lost my confidence just like Al Jazeera.

For the record these Brilliant Hamas strategists who share footnotes on calls that they know would be recorded manage to also identify each other and talk in layman terms- yes the same guys who blind sided the IDF and intelligence for a full year about the October 7th attacks where thousands attacked in coordination after months of open air rehearsals. I am to believe no one saw that coming and the bombing has regressed them in a year to backyard goats who chat like high school girls on call. If this were true the IDF would have located and recovered the hostages instead of shooting at them when they came out waving a white flag.

The factual truth is it was a mishit by the IDF and even though they sued 17kg warheads these explosives set ablaze propane tanks and blankets of the women and children in the tent, engulfing it in flames. Anyone with half a brain can see the footage and realize the fire was the result of a burning camp and exploding gas tanks. I dont believe the IDF intented to kill civilians here, that would do them no favors, but they made a miscalculation on coordinates and possible collaterals and should just accept it as a consequence of war.

As I said Iâm here to learn, not be spoken down to because I hold an opposing view. 

A fine example of a way that the IDF hasnât mitigated the civilian impact would be the use of hundreds of 2000 pound bombs - bunker busters, or MK-84 since you asked for specifics,  bombs that are four times heavier than the bombs dropped by the US against Isis - so no, I donât think Iâm overestimating the Israeli military at all.   Further, these bunker busters were repeatedly dropped in places where the Israeli army had asked Palestinians to evacuate to, again - widely reported and again pointing to a targeting of civilians.   
This is supported by US intelligence reporting that by mid December, 40-45% of the air to ground attacks by Israel were unguided - showing that Israel did not care which targets it was hitting, as long as it was hitting Gaza somehow, this totally undercutting the Israelâs claim of trying to minimise civilian harm.  

Could you *specifically* name what Israel is trying to do to mitigate the civilian death toll? Knowing they are staring down Rafah with a ground and air invasion, despite knowing that there are 1.5 million displaced Palestinian civilians sheltering there AND against the strong advice of all international allies.   

Surely you can appreciate that these things collectively (along with the horrible language Israeli politicians use to describe Palestinians) give the impression to the rest of the world that Israel does not particularly care all that much if civilians get caught up in the cross fire, and can not be bothered taking appropriate steps to ensure as much civilian safety as possible.",7/20/2024 16:10,Pro-Palestine

The Military Advocate General, MG Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi directed the General Staffâs Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism to investigate the strike carried out in Rafah yesterday (Sunday).

Yesterday, IAF aircraft conducted an intelligence-based strike in the area of Rafah against significant terror targets, including senior terrorists in Hamasâ Judea and Samaria Wing who directed terror attacks in Judea and Samaria and carried out murderous attacks against Israeli civilians. 

The strike was carried out based on prior intelligence information regarding the presence of the senior Hamas terrorists at the site of the strike.

Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, the deployment of precise munitions by the IAF, and additional intelligence information. Based on these measures, it was assessed that there would be no expected harm to uninvolved civilians.

In addition, the strike did not occur in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi, to which the IDF has encouraged civilians to evacuate.

The incident is under the investigation of the General Staff's Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism, which is an independent body responsible for examining exceptional incidents in combat. The General Staff's Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism is investigating the circumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area of the strike. The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians during combat.

That fictional situation is different than the one between Gaza and Israel.  It's unlikely a deal can be reached between Hamas and Israel.  However, Hamas is weak.  They can be destroyed, but destroying Hamas while killing tens of thousands of civilians is no victory because then Hamas just gets replaced by Hamas 2, made up of the families of people killed to get rid of Hamas 1.

So, what's needed here is for Israel to limit collateral damage.  They need to evacuate the civilians from Rafah before invading -- they're working on that, but it takes time.  The Biden administration has been putting pressure on them to not rush things, which I think is the right move.

71,"&gt;The entire Israeli leadership agrees on two things: the first, Hamas' proposal is unacceptable. It breaks almost every principle that was established in the talks between Israel, Qatar, Egypt and the USA in recent weeks. \[...\] Israel estimated since the weekend that Hamas' answer would actually be negative.  
The second thing is that, in light of Hamas' answer, Israel has no choice but to try to create an effective military lever that will push the organization into a deal. Israel is very frustrated with the conduct of the White House, which yesterday also released messages assuring the Middle East and the world that the Israeli action is limited and not a deep entry into Rafah. One senior security official said in a discussion yesterday: ""If the Americans don't want us to enter Rafah, they should give the impression that we are ready for it. When they recite that we will not enter, we will be forced to do so, because Hamas feels immune.""  
In general, the White House demonstrated very limited performance in the negotiations. ""At least we brought a proposal from Hamas to the table,"" said a senior American official to his colleagues in Israel in recent days, ""at least we brought something."" He sounds almost desperate, but the prevailing feeling in the Israeli leadership regarding Washington is disappointment. It seems that they are chasing Hamas, instead of being ready to threaten it, and that doesn't advance the deal. That is all the members of the war cabinet and the prime minister agree on.  
But the internal problems in the Israeli leadership are very acute, and so are the words. Sources involved in the negotiations consistently accuse the Prime Minister of making aggressive use of the media and sensitive intelligence because he is not interested in a deal, ""and this does not contradict,"" one source told me, ""the fact that Yahya Sinwar also does not want a deal."" The latest example, which causes a significant upheaval in the political elite in Israel, was Hamas' response the evening of the day before yesterday. Israel's representative to receive the response was head of the Mossad, Dedi Barnea. Barnea informed the Prime Minister's military secretary, and the negotiating team - which includes head of the Shin Bet and Major General Nitzan sit. Alon, responsible for prisoners and missing persons.  
At this time, Hamas has already started issuing announcements that it said ""yes"" to the deal, and in Rafah people are celebrating in the streets. The international media is almost reporting regional peace already. But the ministers of the war cabinet (including the defense minister), as well as the chief of staff and [Aman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Intelligence_Directorate_(Israel)), have not yet received Hamas' response. In fact, they hear about the answer, and that it is a ""trick"" or a ""scam"", on the television channels. They don't have any time to digest, while Prime Minister Netanyahu already has the response, and perhaps also the analysis of it, which he received from the Mossad - and is also starting to use these to dictate an outline for the media.

Based on [the posts he was making on Telegram that day](https://m.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/gaza-news/article-772827), it seems he was in really tight with Hamas and supporting their efforts. 

Ashraf Amra and Mohammed Fayq Abu Mostafa - [had been honored by Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in the past, and filmed some of the attacks in Israel on October 7, giddily sharing them on their social media channels and imploring the citizens of Gaza to follow Hamas into Israel now](https://honestreporting.com/exposed-gaza-photojournalists-shared-call-to-infiltrate-israel-on-oct-7/?swcfpc=1).

[He also shared a video in which he is heard saying, ""The brothers advanced, 'Masha'Allah' may God bless.""](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byjpcge26)

You are saying ""Hamas can murder people because attacking Hamas will kill poor civilians"" and yes civilian deaths are sad but that's on Hamas. Civilians should be in shelters and Hamas should fight outside but it's not the case is it?

The standard narrative was the exact opposite: The IDF was invincible and Hamas was a ragtag bunch of poorly trained ""pray and spray"" zealots with no situational awareness in battle.

Hamas has been trained for nearly 20 years by Iran's Quds Force, so it would be foolish of the IDF to think Hamas would be pushovers. After the atrocious Oct 7 terrorist attack, we would hope that Hamas fighters would be easy targets, but given that perhaps 1 in 100 Gazans belong to the military wing of Hamas, and there have been 10,000+ total deaths amongst the Palestinians and aid workers, it seems likely that the overwhelming majority of dead and injured Palestinians are innocent civilians caught up in the IDF bombings.

106,"&gt; Israel is not ""attacking civilians"".

So you think all those children that being blown to pieces are Hamas terrorists?

&gt; What Hamas did on October 7th is attacking civilians.

Not disputing that.

&gt; Hamas is currently using civilians as a human shield (a war crime) to sacrifice them at the altar of PR in an effort to radicalize more people to their cause.

If Hamas were hiding underneath Israeli hospitals or schools, would you bomb the Israeli hospitals and schools with all the patients and children still in them?

&gt; I ask you in good faith is there any legitimate retaliation which you would accept from Israel on the back of the October 7th Hamas terror attack which largely targetted civilians and killed like 1400+ people? Please articulate to me specifically what would be acceptable.

Absolutely. I see three or four strategies better than Israel's current genocidal approach that has already seen Israel commit numerous war crimes:

1. Osama bin Laden was killed by US Navy Seals in an operation deep within hostile Pakistani territory. They were able to slip in, kill their target, and extract with zero civilian casualties. If Israel were to successfully employ this strategy (keywords being ""successful"" and ""zero civilian casualties""), not only would there not be any war crimes, but the PR would word to Israel's favor.

2. After the Munich massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics, Israel sent teams of assassins across Europe and the Middle East to kill those responsible for the attack. These teams went to extraordinary lengths to ensure not only that there were no civilian casualties, but also to ensure that the families of the terrorists being targeted were not harmed. This approach would of course cause some diplomatic problems for Israel in terms of Israeli assassins killing people on sovereign territory, but I think it would be hard to get too outraged given these are terrorists and no civilians have been harmed.

3. After WWII, Israel sent teams of undercover agents to identify, abduct, and covertly extradite wanted Nazi war criminals for trial in Israel. Again, this might cause some minor problems in terms of diplomatic relationships, but I would imagine most people would sympathize with Israel on this actions. The US did something similar with its Extraordinary Rendition program. It was controversial, but it took some terrorists off the playing field without causing massive civilian casualties.

4. I'll be clear from the outset that this one will not be popular, but it remains something that should be considered. After the 9/11 attacks, when the US wanted to go into Afghanistan to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, the Taliban threatened to militarily oppose the US. The US responded by arming and supporting the Northern Alliance opposition movement who were eventually able to overthrow the Taliban and give space for the US to focus on hunting bin Laden. Israeli apologists often argue that the Gazan people are guilty by association because they've not risen up against Hamas; therefore, they must support Hamas. However, the reality is that Hamas have all the guns and the people have nothing to fight with if they wanted to overthrow Hamas. With this in mind...and I recognize that this is a ballsy move...arming the Gazan people to fight Hamas and a return to Palestinian Authority control might have averted a lot of civilian casualties, as well as showing Israel's commitment to respecting the right of Gazans to self-liberation.",5/27/2024 6:22,Pro-Palestine

1. there was no active warfare before October 7th, taking hostages and killing civilian poopulations in their homes and music festival broke the current ceasefire.

  
2. The Israeli government did not say they want to destroy Gaza, their goal is to destroy the Hamas terror organisation that rules Gaza whom entire charter revolves around killing Jews and that stated they would commit more Octoeber 7th attacks and take more hostages when given the chance, which I think is a valid cause.

  
3. If the goal was to destroy all Gaza there will be no Gaza nor Gazans come November- I think you don't understand how much artilery power and ammunition Israel has and how densely populated Gaza is - the IDF can literally wipe down every Gazan without a single solider stepping inside it if it was the goal.

  
4. no one bombs the west bank buddy.

  
5.IDF doesn't indiscriminately kill civilians (roof knocks, texts, leaflets), if anyone breaks international law is Hamas and in numerous ocassions, it is valid under international law to bomb civilian infrastractures if they are used by enemy combatants. (literally just read international law it is in the UN page)

  
6. if you had read the Hamas deal you would have seen it includes the release of only 1/4 of the hostages and IDF leaving Gaza which means the war will end but 90 hostages will still remain under Hamas rules- more than that, 3 of the hostages that were rescued yesterday were not even gonna be part of any deal and without IDF literally taking them out the would have stayed in gaza indefintly , what would you think would happen to them after the war would be over?  Hamas would just let them go from the kindness of their hearts? I think it is also worth reminding you that Hamas held 2 bodies and 1 hostage in Gaza for years even before the October 7th attack and they are still there.

Well, still anecdotal, and restricts ""pro-Palestinian"" to meaning only people attending protests and chanting loudly enough for you to hear them.

It's an argument you've seen a lot from people who try to prove Israel's offensive to be a genocide, and one which was deconstructed by the evacuation.

No it isn't.

&gt;You fail to mention several other reasons for that matter; one being this is a zone Israel ordered evacuations for, but wasn't evacuated.

No, Israel ordered evacuations *to* the area where the strike occured:

https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/rafah-tent-fire-gaza-israel-war-1.7215999

&gt;The other being the likely presence of a vehicle filled with munitions in the area. A video filmed by Palestinians on the ground in the immediate aftermath of the fire has them suggesting the fire was started by shrapnel hitting a vehicle filled with munitions

If it was caused by a truck of munitions you'd expect Israel to release whatever drone footage they must have used to confirm the strike hit the people they intended it to. In the case of the WCK strike they allowed journalists to view the footage at least. In this case they've just said they're ""examining possibilities that it set off munitions"", but haven't actually said that it did, and if you've followed the war in Ukraine you'll know that secondary explosions are pretty damn obvious.

&gt;Said shrapnel was studied, and it's suggested Israel likely used a type of bomb specifically designed to limit civilian casualties. In this instance, the fault on the fire falls on Hamas for storing munitions in a civilian area in the first place, and it perfectly proves just why a Rafah offensive is a must, and why Rafah needs to be evacuated. 

Yeah no that's massively jumping the gun. It's possible but not at all confirmed, and the munitions Israel used could easily have started that fire if they landed near flammable materials:

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-made-bomb-israeli-strike-rafah-munitions-experts-say/

&gt;Hamas proved time and time again they are happy to hide among civilians, and won't stop doing so. The only way to actually move forward towards a permanent resolution to this war is by seperating them from the civilians and taking them down, and that cannot be achieved without evacuating Rafah. 

But it clearly hasn't been achieved by evacuating Rafah.

&gt;Again, that doesn't prove in any way that it is better than Al Mawasi. If you were to speak of its proximity to the Rafah crossing I'd understand, but fact of the matter is, Rafah has been bombed far more extensively than Al Mawasi,

These aren't comparable. You're talking about actual homes with plumbing and electricity and toilets versus tents where people sleep on the ground and shit in a bucket. Al Mawasi doesn't have facilities to destroy.

&gt;That's a valid argument. But I fail to see why the argument shouldn't be to provide these needs better rather than nulling any offensive, which just serves to do exactly what I spoke of above. 

Because the only ones who could control that are Israel, who nobody trusts to do so and who have just failed to do so. Or chose not to. They're the limiting factor here.

&gt;I don't think it's either of those. I acknowledge no part of Gaza is perfectly safe nor has the most adequate facilities. What I'm challenging is your view that Rafah is better, despite no tangible proof of the matter,

I don't feel I need to prove that homes are better than tents. We all just sort of already know this, don't we? Not to mention we've just seen a fire tearing through those tents and killing or injuring hundreds of people.",5/21/2024 16:52,Pro-Israel

Hamas wants Palestinians dead so they can garner sympathy from the West. The fact is that Muslims in the Middle East have always hated Jews.

Safe to say, it's already taken quite a serious hit to its stockpiles and infrastructure as a result and, thus far, has very little to show for it. If the IDF decides to engage in south Lebanon in order to push the group north of the Litani river as per UN resolution, Hezbollah posses significantly less of a threat than it did on Oct 6th. They do still pose a deadly threat, however, and will cause serious damage to northern and central Israel via medium and long range missiles, which they have stockpiled in the tune of hundreds of thousands. Many of their troops are battle hardened from years of engagement in Syria.

Interesting to note: as of today the IDF has lost 253 soldiers since the start of Gaza operations, during which time is has eliminated 19 of Hamas's 24 battalions. (The last 4 battalions are hiding in Rafah). A higher number of Hezbollah soldiers than that have already been killed as a result of the exchanges with IL since Oct 8th.

But look, if logos and pathos make up the two of the three points of the argumentative triangle, I'm appealing to both; for I made a clearly logical quantifiably-proven reality that Israel has murdered more civilians overall. This is, indeed a numbers game, and Israel has committed the greater offense, logically. Moreover I wager with 20 years of failed US middle east policy that this will only increase radicalization in the area by reducing stability and creating more orphans who become the next generation of fighters, bitter that an Israeli air-strike killed their sister, mother, and father. This is as much a rational, logical appeal as it is an emotionally-realistic one.

I'll note what I wrote to someone else in saying that I'm pro-civilian above all else. I'm equally a numbers man as equally to the fact that I am an emotionally-intelligent individual with high levels of empathy that allow me to place myself in the shoes of someone else. I suspect you're not pro-civilian because you make excuses for the murderer who killed **20x** the number of innocent people in response (yes subtracting roughly the 4,000-6,000 Hamas fighters per recent US intelligence reports).

It wasn't Hamas who told Netanyahu to drop 500 and 2,000lb bombs on densely-populated civilian centers. It wasn't Hamas who told the IDF to throw out their collateral-damage assessment calculations, per IDF whistle-blowers.

At the end of the day, it was IDF and IDF alone who decided to pull the trigger and say, ""Yes, 3-5 children is worth killing for every dead Hamas terrorist."" And you say that's A-Okay in your book.

It would take 20 October 7ths for Hamas to make up what Israel has already done in murder. 

It is murder; there's no other word for it. The cognitive dissonance is absolutely astounding. If what Hamas did on October 7th is murder against civilians, so too is what Israel is doing to Palestinian civilians. Period.

It's a sad day when Robert McNamara of all people responsible for widespread civilian deaths in WWII and Vietnam confessed near the end of his life, ""Proportionality should be a guideline to war.""

If you're killing 20x more civilians than the terrorists, you are quantifiably a greater terrorist.

At some point, Israel is responsible for the knee-jerk disproportionate overreaction they have. And I'm curious short of nukes what that line exactly is for you. How many dead women and children are you willing to execute for each Hamas terrorist? 

Tell me, would you be willing to shoot them yourself? For there is no difference.

I think I've made a very compelling case that if Israel's goal is to reduce terrorism, their actions have only exacerbated the problem for decades to come. I think I've also made the case that Israel and Israel alone is responsible for pulling the trigger in not just killing, but murdering a massive number of women and children.

And occupations are supposed to rebuild the occupied lands and withdraw after a short time. America's occupation of West Germany after WW2 lasted 4 years while the occupation of Japan lasted 7 years. During that time, America implemented the Marshal Plan and the Reverse Course Policy to rebuild Germany and Japan.

Compare that with Israel. The occupation has lasted more than 50 years now, no peace has been achieved while not a single Israeli economic re-development plan in the West Bank has been implemented in the last 50 years. Israel could've chosen to rebuild the West Bank like Germany and Japan today post-WW2 but instead, chose to implement a brutal military occupation further increasing violence and radicalism.

If the occupation was intended to prevent another Palestinian terrorist attack, why didn't Israel never tried implementing an economic plan in the West Bank like America did after WW2? America succeeded in their occupation where Israel failed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Palestinians got the full responsibility for which organizations get power. If the majority want peace and willing to fight hamas and fatah for their future they could do it at any moment. The simple fact is that they don't. And like you said, Palestinians support Hamas after PLO disappoint them. They give around 75% support to hamas. Palestinians literally choose war and violence, no excuses.

Because Israel showed how any peace attempts from the Palestinians would end in failure and nothing. Israel has much to blame for rejecting the PLO's efforts for peace and effectively betrayed them by turning the PA into a puppet government. They basically left (what could have been a Palestinian ally) to die. Arafat had warned that should the PLO's efforts be in vain, Hamas would take over the reigns.

The Palestinians saw how the PLO's attempts ended in failure. Had Israel accepted and supported the PLO's peace efforts, the Palestinians wouldn't be so quick to choose Hamas. The PLO would actually have proof doing peace with Israel is a real possibility.

Israel effectively doomed themselves to 20 years of war in Gaza by not supporting the PLO/PA's peace efforts and abandoning them in the end.

&gt;Israel doesn't have to do anything. Palestinians get the freedom to choose whoever they want. If israel interfere with Palestinian election you would really get a puppet government. Palestinians simply choosing war time after time.

I'm not saying Israel is innocent om everything, nor are their hands clean, but why do you think this happened?

This Hamas terrorist attack was successful because Israel believed Hamas was more interested in financial incentives and ""possibly"" bettering Gaza for its people. Israel let their guard down and they were stabbed for it. If Gaza is a ""victim"" in all of this, then why is it that Egypt also keeps a tight lid on Gaza, just like Israel. Is it because Palestinians have caused absolute chaos in these countries in the past? Yes, it is. They've also caused nothing but problems for Jordan and Lebanon. 

What happened to the Palestinians in 48' sucks, it really does, but it is not going to change or be reverted back. Palestinians are not going to be given their territory back, especially not when crap like this keeps occurring. The best thing Palestinians can do now is accept that if they want their own, independent country .... then it's probably best to stop the disgusting terrorism and violence. Find a peaceful solution and stop believing that you are going to reclaim all of your territory, as it's never going to happen. Some of the deals that Israel has offered in the past were INCREDIBLE! Yet, Abbas said no because they don't want peace, they want conflict. If peace does come, people like Abbas and groups like Hamas lose all of their power so instead, they do horrific terrorism like October the 7th.

Israel isn't innocent either, but they have a right to remove Hamas, or to at least degrade its ability to carry out other attacks for the near future.

&gt;They look upon Palestine with the same instinctive love and true fervor that any Aztec looked upon his Mexico or any Sioux looked upon his prairie...Individual Arabs may perhaps be bought off but this hardly means that all the Arabs in Eretz Israel are willing to sell a patriotism that not even Papuans will trade. **Every indigenous people will resist alien settlers as long as they see any hope of ridding themselves of the danger of foreign settlement.**

&gt;**That is what the Arabs in Palestine are doing**, and what they will persist in doing as long as there remains a solitary spark of hope that they will be able to prevent the transformation of âPalestineâ into the âLand of Israelâ

162,"&gt;Context: Egypt also has a blockade on Gaza and both countries put the blockade in place after a terror group that wants to genocide all Jews was elected in Gaza. 

Further context: The Egyptian government is a military dictatorship an key regional ally of the United States, and the only elected Egyptian government in memory, under a Muslim Brotherhood president, before being overthrown, had lifted the blockade to allow border crossings in Rafah.  This was one of many reasons that he was ultimately overthrown.  The Egytian government has a very complicated relationship with Hamas and the Gaza Strip generally, and there is very little doubt that the main thrust of the blockade in its current form is American pressure.  In fact, Egyptian dissidents are the real collateral damage for Sisi's continued support of the blockade.  The US has turned a blind eye to an extremely abusive dictatorship that allowed for Israel's blockade to continue.  

The fragility of this position is best seen in the way that the American leadership has been forced to signal that its support of the blockade is no longer unconditional, and that support for Israel's Gaza policy faces the same hurdles.  Our government harbors no desire to see Hamas gain prominence in the Arab street, or for Islamists to use this as a rallying cry against our core regional partners.  So that means that this is likely the end for Israel's Gaza policy, and for its ability to wage wars without interference from the Security Council.  

America is just not that into her anymore.   

&gt;It makes complete sense that they would have strict borders and wouldn't just allow citizens of an unfriendly neighboring country with a sizeable terror problem including some from Hamas to just freely use the same roads as Israeli citizens.

What *are* Israel's borders? As an entity, does Israel have any actual borders? This seems like a fundamental disconnect, because the entirety of the West Bank is not recognized as part of Israel.

Where exactly are the Gazan people who did not commit rape/murder AND did not condone rape/murder?

Let's just take the rape question.

Online you can find the videos that the Hamas terrorists posted of themselves, returning to Gaza, with naked, beaten, and likely raped women...who had just been murdered or might just about to be murdered.

Here is one. A Jewish woman is cowering, obviously, raped, about to be killed in her last moments, she is hearing people jeering at her torn, naked flesh.

https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/s/x76uj6FeQr

In the other videos you can see the people of Gaza cheering, laughing, taunting, just having a really wonderful happy moment. 

MORE important you do NOT see anyone speaking up.

You do not see any religious leaders, business leaders, humanitarian leaders, anyone at all speaking up and saying ""wait, stop, this is not our cause"" or ""not in our name!""

Do you honestly think that that could happen publicly anywhere else in the world and NOBODY speak up? 

You have to stop this ridiculous line of distinguishing between the ordinary Palestinians (adults) and Hamas.

As I said it's racist to say ""Hamas does not represent the ordinary Gazan."" What you are saying is that ""I, as a white Westerner, think this way, and so all people in the world must think as I do.""

By the way, I am not a white westerner and I can tell you not everybody in the world thinks exactly like white Westerners.

No, different people in different parts of the world may hold completely different values for political, religious, cultural, or many other reasons.

It feels odd that I have to spell this out but obviously it is a widespread assumption, especially in the left-wing intellectual circles in the west, that all people are moderate in the majority and radicals are only in the minority.

Yet...we have no evidence that, for example, anyone in Gaza opposed rape of Jewish women.

I'm glad to hear that the kings of Oman or Bahrain or a Saudi Minister opposed it -- weeks later.

But apparently nobody in Gaza opposed it, and from what we're seeing on the streets of London and Toronto, millions of white leftists and Palestinians/Arabs are perfectly fine with the mass rape of women.

Most recently we learned:

-Hostages have been farmed out to elements within the Gaza population

-One of the hostages escaped, and then was captured by ordinary Gaza citizens, and returned to the terrorists.

-Gazans stoning hostage RC bus... a blatant violation of every rule of hostage release done spontaneously by the ""people of Gaza""

https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8PUrVLt/

-it is now coming out how the hostages were treated terribly, not just by their ""captors,"" but everyone they came into contact with as in ""let's turn the Jew into a sex slave.""

Finally, we have very simple public opinion poll data. I mean I assume it must be very difficult to actually do these polls, but they always show overwhelming support for terrorism and they certainly show right now on the West Bank and Gaza overwhelming support for October 7.

Again, prove this wrong without resorting to waving hands in the air and stating a variation of ""all the people of Gaza are just like me.""

""You are being racist."" You say? ""You are trying to say that the Gazans are monsters.""

No, it is the western leftists and pseudo-intellectuals and useful idiots who are saying that the Gazans cannot hold an opinion that you don't approve of.

I guess I have a horrible notion that October 7 was wrong, it was an act of genocide and all of what Israel has done never merited such a ""resistance"". On the other hand, Pro-palestinians will argue that October 7 does not merit this genocide they are currently in (which I see as just a very one-sided war). I can agree with this, especially since there is no plan as far as I am aware of what happens after the war is over, but I absolutely despise that they are being hypocrites over this one point.

Additionally, the river to the sea Palestine will be free is great if they mean that Gaza and the West Bank will be self-governed, sovereign nations without the need for Israel to turn on its electricity and supply them with water, and to be ruled by a tolerant, peaceful leader (unlikely), but if they mean that the whole of internationally recognized Israel should be Palestine, then...hello? How can this be achieved? IF it can be achieved? That's not even the problem though, because this is literally Genocide. I love how loud they can be if ""genocide"" is happening to them, but so silent when it comes to Sudan, Armenia, Uyghurs, Ukrainians, YEMENIS who suffered 377000 casualties, and least of all Israelis. I would argue what is happening in the West Bank is more of a genocide than the situation in Gaza, which is a war.

&gt; IDF forces are carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital, based on intelligence information and an operational necessity. The IDF is conducting a ground operation in Gaza to defeat Hamas and rescue our hostages. Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the civilians in Gaza.
The IDF forces include medical teams and Arabic speakers, who have undergone specified training to prepare for this complex and sensitive environment, with the intent that no harm is caused to the civilians being used by Hamas as human shields. 

&gt; In recent weeks, the IDF has publicly warned time and again that Hamasâ continued military use of the Shifa hospital jeopardizes its protected status under international law, and enabled ample time to stop this unlawful abuse of the hospital. 

&gt; Yesterday, the IDF conveyed to the relevant authorities in Gaza once again that all military activities within the hospital must cease within 12 hours. Unfortunately, they did not.

In that way, Egypt supported a terrorist genocidal party (Hamas) to grow and have the artillery they needed to try to genocide Israeli civilians

You're a smart kid. Think critically here. What does ""Stand with Israel"" even mean? Jews just experienced the worst mass killing of their people since the Holocaust. Hamas, as I'm sure you are aware, isn't some progressive social democratic group - they're religious extremists whose vision for Palestine is the destruction of Israel, the extirpation of the Jews living there, and the creation of an Islamic state. Hamas still holds hundreds of hostages. Israel is the only country I am aware of whose very existence is challenged.

Is it at least *possible* that ""Stand with Israel"" in this case may simply mean they have solidarity with Israelis killed and kidnapped and don't wish the only Jewish-majority country to be wiped off the map? And that this doesn't logically or necessarily mean they stand with every single action of the Israeli state or military?

In addition, what does it mean to be ""pro-Palestine""? Does being ""pro-Palestine"" absolutely require you to be ""anti-Israel""?

CNN Oren Liebermann reported from Gaza under Israel Defense Forces escort at all times. As a condition for journalists to join the embed with the IDF, media outlets must submit footage filmed in Gaza to the Israeli military for review. CNN retained editorial control over the final report. https://youtu.be/NDc9zmID9J8

IDF review is to ensure IDF personnels faces are blurred out and maybe military sensitive information are not included in the footage (showing the location of IDF base of operations, etcâ¦) just the video footage. What CNN and other media writes in their reports are entirely up to them, CNN has confirmed that they retained editorial control over the final report.

With the updated UN death totals just under or over 15k civilian deaths against 35k deaths in total. The ratio being 1.25-1 combatant to civilian death ratio. Which is the best ratio for combatants to civilian death in modern history in urban warfare. The example people use recently is Russia in melitopol which I believe was a 1-4 ratio for combatant to civilian death ratio. Also the US in Mosul in 2017 was 1-5 or 1-6 I believe. Meaning that of recent urban conflicts they are at least 4x better than other nations. We canât even get into how bad those ratios are in Syria or Sudan as of now. Hamas terror attack on 07/10 was 1-4 combatant to civilian death ratio. Still after months of fighting where Israeli civilians are relatively well protected and their troops are on the ground in formerly Hamas occupied territory that ratio is about 1-2. Thatâs if we donât count all of the Palestinian civilians weâve seen murdered by Hamas one way or another on here.

So, for example, they will by default just assume that the ""radicals"" in any given population, like Gaza, MUST be in the minority. But is there actually any evidence of that?

Where exactly are the Gazan people who did not commit rape/murder AND did not condone rape/murder?

Let's just take the rape question.

Online you can find the videos that the Hamas terrorists posted of themselves, returning to Gaza, with naked, beaten, and likely raped women...who had just been murdered or might just about to be murdered.

You can see the people of Gaza cheering, laughing, taunting, just having a really wonderful happy moment. 

MORE important you do NOT see anyone speaking up.

You do not see any religious leaders, business leaders, humanitarian leaders, anyone at all speaking up and saying ""wait, stop, this is not our cause"" or ""not in our name!""

Do you honestly think that that could happen publicly anywhere else in the world and NOBODY speak up? 

You have to stop this ridiculous line of distinguishing between the ordinary Palestinians (adults) and Hamas.

As I said it's very racist to say ""Hamas does not represent the ordinary Gazan."" What you are saying is that I, as a white Westerner, think this way, and so all people in the world must think as I do.

By the way, I am not a white westerner and I can tell you not everybody in the world thinks exactly like white Westerners.

No, different people in different parts of the world may hold completely different values for political, religious, cultural, or many other reasons.

It feels odd, that I have to spell this out but obviously it is a widespread assumption, especially in the left-wing intellectual circles in the west, that all people are moderate in the majority and radicals are only in the minority.

Yet...have no evidence that anyone in Gaza opposed rape of Jewish women.

I'm glad to hear that the kings of Oman or Bahrain opposed it -- weeks later.

But apparently nobody in Gaza opposed it, and from what we're seeing on the streets of London and Toronto, millions of white leftists and Palestinians/Arabs are perfectly fine with the mass rape of women.

Well yes if they can.  This level of destruction though and often the occupying army needs to take over.  There are no shortage of Arabs and international players willing to help.  Israel could pick . 

&gt; Violence at the point of delivery is causing trucks to file into the Rafah crossing and then sit there.

That's not what the agencies are saying.  They are saying Israel is stopping them from crossing.  Assume that were the case though.  Have the IDF escort the trucks in a large group. 

&gt; And they have an excellent case that many aid agencies aren't actually aid agencies at all, but actually active belligerents on the side of Hamas.

I would agree they can make that case.

In the 80âs Meshi-Zahav led an extremist ultra-orthodox movement that protested archeological digs, and reportedly threatened doctors with fake explosives and bullets. They operated a legal dept for decades whose entire purpose was blocking police and pathologists from doing examinations on dead bodies, hampering criminal investigations.**


Yossi Landau, a trusted witness for NYT said,

âWhen we go into a house, we use our imagination,â when describing the groupâs work at the October 7 attack sites. âThe bodies were telling us what happened, thatâs what happened.""

He also proclaimed in a Dec 3 interview that anyone who questions his stories âshould be together with the Hamas terrorists, and he should be killed.â. He has talked openly on four occasions of inventing stories. Another Zaka official said in an Israeli Foreign Ministry video, âThe walls, the stone shouted: âI was raped.ââ This nonsense wouldn't even be considered anywhere else.

Weâre in a situation where itâs literally this shady group making up whatever they want, and the western media ideologically rushing to report it and yell it on their front pages trying to make it global, making others global news out of nothing, mass ramblings that wouldnât even be considered even for a second anywhere, embarrassing themselves by it getting exposed and still insisting on it. This is such imposed madness.


Their botching of bodies and forensics:


They have no medical training of any sort and it was reported by zionist media that senior military officials sent these âvolunteersâ instead of soldiers. When soldiers trained in recovery were finally let in the second week after the attack, they were alarmed by ZAKAâs actions. According to Israeli media, ZAKA failed to document remains, put parts from different bodies in the same bag, and did not collect all the remains in homes and the field. Zaka volunteers apparently did find time to rewrap already bagged remains in material that âprominently displayed the ZAKA logo.â

**Zaka reportedly turned massacre sites into a âwar room for donations,â used corpses as fundraising props, spread accounts of atrocities that never happened, and botched forensics that are central to Israelâs claim that Hamas carried out a systematic campaign of mass rape. ZAKA volunteers seemed more interested in getting the money rather than the bodies.**

A zionist newspaper published a photo of Zaka members carrying out fundraising activities near a dead body; sources from other rescue groups observed Zaka volunteers make fundraising calls and videos with corpses in the background. The second week after the attacks, the Defense Ministry began paying Zaka for its work on the ground.

Then why did senior military officials send them and not trained people? **They are an invaluable part of ''Israelâ's propaganda machine**:

âBut we need to buy time, which we also buy by turning to world leaders and to public opinion. You have an important role in influencing public opinion, which also influences leaders. We are in a war; it will continue. The war is not only to take care of the 1,400 peopleâ¦but also to give us the maneuvering room.â  â Netanyahu to ZAKA.


In an interview with âisraeliâ YNET, Nitzan Chen, director of the govt. The press office, said, âItâs hard for me to imagine Israeli hasbara advocacy vis-a-vis the foreign press without the amazing, effective activity of Zaka people.â


In the same article, a volunteer consultant in the PMâs National Information Directorate, a public diplomacy office, explained how Zaka volunteers influenced news coverage.


âThe testimonies of Zaka volunteers, as first responders on the ground, had a decisive impact in exposing the atrocities in the South to the foreign journalists covering the war,â Schwartz said. âThe entire state of Israel was engaged in framing the narrative that Hamas is equal to ISIS and in deepening the legitimacy of the state to act with great force.â [(meanwhile ISIS condemned Hamas, spouted zionist propaganda of it being an âIranian projectâ and told them to instead fight Shia. Israel has a massive history of supporting ISIS and Al Qaeda groups in Syria)](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheDeprogram/comments/1928ltc/isis_condemns_hamas_im_not_joking_isiss/?share_id=jBPakN8kxabCliUl8q7Y7&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1)

âThe first-hand testimonies of the organizationâs amazing men of grace, who were exposed to the most difficult sights, had a tremendous impact on the reporters,â he went on. âThese testimonies of Zaka people caused a horror and revealed to the reporters what kind of human-monsters we are talking about.â

In an email from Zaka leader Yoni Gilboa to potential donors obtained by The Electronic Intifada, Zaka even justified the latest Israeli attack on al-Shifa hospital, in northern Gaza.

This is what is happening, the biggest rapists and rape supporters are accusing the Palestinians of what they have no history or present of, and it's being made into a thing by the fascist western media dragging everyone back to dark ages â complete upside down mirror politics.

251,"&gt;Palestinians get a State, that is a very significant give.

All of Palestine is their homeland...  It's not a ""give""  You can't ""give"" somebody their homeland.

&gt;Why are they entitled to guarantees beyond this?

Because you're asking for guarantees?  If you don't want guarantees you don't have to offer any guarantees.

&gt;Frankly I cannot think of any State created voluntarily out of territory of another, ideas of self determination aside.

There are probably plenty of examples but they probably don't demonstrate what you think they demonstrate because you probably don't understand the central concept of self-determination.

&gt;I would also observe the systemic problem Palestinians have with the Israeli State isnât terrorism, itâs the formal military.

The IDF is one of the main problems though it was founded by combing foreign terrorist militias and arguably never stopped being a terrorist organization.

&gt;This matters because itâs much easier for Israel to credibly promise not to invade Palestine than Palestine to promise there wonât be terrorist attacks.  

israel can't credibly promise that because every day more israeli state supported illegal immigrants move to the Palestinian West Bank and violently occupy it, steal native Palestinian land, destroy native Palestinian property, and illegally build outposts on Palestinian land...

israel has turned it's civilian population into a colonizing force.  One that carries out illegal violent colonization somewhat independently.

You never said what groups the irgun/likud, lehi, or haganah were...

They are terrorist groups.

israel was founded by violent foreign terrorists.  The idf was founded by combining violent foreign terrorist militias.

So basically they're in denial. I don't know what you want me to say because the fact that they're ignorant about their own actions is the exact problem.

&gt;Hamas rejecting them"", for instance Israel simply isn't interested in a permanent ceasefire but an invasion of Rafah even if it is delayed. I think we're past the point of no return

Israel had two conditions. Hamas surrenders and release all hostages. Surrenders for crimes gaaisnt humanity. Seems quite straightforward and fair. If you murder some you can't get away with it. Exactly what rest of the civilised world follows. Hamas wants permanent ceasefire so they can stay in power. It's so obvious. Unlike hamas Israel isn't heartless enough to just lie about it, rescue their hostages and then invade. It would basically be the same tactic as what hamas did on October 7th after the previous ceasefire. 

&gt;What ""agenda with Hamas""? He is literally just trying to spread awareness of what his people are going through. They can't win with people like you

I addressed this twice In my previous comment. Dark patterns and being suggestive and obsessive use of term genocide and occupation. 

&gt;Again, you are committing the burden of proof fallacy. I already tackled everything you said, there was not a shred

No you didn't. You just dismissed everything I said which isn't the same as tackling. There is zero evidence he condemn hamas, there is no info about how he ended up in Qatar and there is no real reason as to why he gets the privilege of the top 1 percent w in terms of money and travel visas.

Also I corroborated my suspicion even more with a report that got a hold of the screenshot of posts he made on October 7th

Nowhere have I said anything to do with the deaths of Palestinians. All of my responses have been in response to the false assertion that Israel doesn't have free speech.

They're not alleged thought crimes. They're provable hate speech posts on social media.

&gt; probably a well-placed camera of terror attacks. 

Unrelated, but do you mean the well-placed camera's that Hamas terrorists used that they strapped to their heads and chests when they murdered innocents?

&gt; Terror attacks should not be used as the pretext for mass murder. 

It's not a pretext, it's a justifiable sasus belli response to being attacked by the governing body of a neighbour.

Certainly seems like it, but whatever helps you sleep at night.

&gt; The fact that you can't separate this is amazing

I separated it perfectly fine. I was discussing free speech. You're conflating it with the current war.

&gt; but no, you can't kill entire populations because you think they celebrated.

And that's not what's happening. If you actually read this thread **carefully** you'll see it's a discussion of how people in Israel are being arrested and charged for hate speech and some people (falsely) claim this is against free speech.

Israel didn't attack Gaza because its citizens celebrated Hamas' slaughtering its civilians, it attacked Gaza to remove Hamas and prevent something like that happening again (exactly how Hamas have said they'd do it over and over again).

These concerns pertain to the whole of the Gaza Strip though are especially acute in the northern governorates.

1. Israel is targeting Hamas terrorists and actually doing all it can to not kill innocent civilians. Hamas is hiding behind its civilians and prevents them from evacuating. Israel started with 'Hakesh bagag' tactic (popular tactic with IDF to warn a building before a strike so it's civilians can evacuate), it continued with dropping leaflets in northern Gaza informing the gazans to evacuate. It even hacked Hamass TV to warn Gazans to leave. It now secures a humanitarian passage towards southern gaza (ironically from Hamas) so that the remaining Gazans can evacuate to the south. It even gave Shifaa hospital last night 300 liters of diesel for its incubators which Hamas prevents the hospital from collecting.  In addition Israel permits hundreds of trucks to enter from Rafah (Egypt) so that the southern part will have enough water food and medicine.

2. Israel is responding to Hamas's terror attack with the purpose of destroying Hamas's military and civil power in Gaza. This is to prevent such an attack in the future and to deter organizations worldwide that killing civilians and hiding behind your own does not protect you from complete annihilation.

276,"This is not misinformation. There is extensive footage showing Hamas using populated facilities and residential areas for military and terror activities. From the beginning of the war, security cameras at Shifa Hospital have captured hostages being smuggled through terror tunnels. There is abundant evidence of Hamas firing rockets from densely populated areas and numerous weapons and terror bases, including extensive tunnels, have been discovered. Therefore, it's incorrect to claim this information has been debunked when it is actually true.

If you wonât dismiss any footage or article I bring with âZionist lies and or propagandaâ I will give you links to see the footages and articles yourself, but you can easily find it by looking up google or asking ChatGPT.

Edit: hereâs a quick response from ChatGPT:

Reports indicate that Hamas has indeed used civilian facilities and residential areas in Gaza for military purposes. For example, several sources, including Jewish Insider and The Times of Israel, have detailed how Hamas operates within hospitals, using them as command centers and storage for weapons. Al-Shifa Hospital, in particular, has been cited multiple times, with evidence suggesting it has been used to shield militants and store arms, complicating efforts to conduct military operations without endangering civilians [citation1,How Gaza hospitals have become the front line in Israelâs war against Hamas](https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/gaza-hospitals-hamas-israel-idf-war-military-operations-terrorists/) [oai_citation:2,US backs Israeli claims on Hamas use of hospitals, including Shifa, for military ops | The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-backs-israeli-claims-on-hamas-use-of-hospitals-including-shifa-for-military-ops/) [3,IDF releases new intel detailing Hamas use of Gaza hospitals for terror purposes | The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-releases-new-intel-detailing-hamas-use-of-gaza-hospitals-for-terror-purposes/).

Additionally, footage and intelligence shared by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) illustrate Hamas firing rockets from densely populated areas, leveraging the presence of civilians to deter retaliation. This tactic has been widely condemned as it puts non-combatants at significant risk. Extensive footage and intelligence reports confirm that Hamas has used civilian facilities and residential areas for military purposes during the conflict. Specifically, there are documented instances of Hamas smuggling hostages into Shifa Hospital through terror tunnels and using the hospital as a command center.

This is from 2nd January. I included this to stress how serious the situation is. 5-7 Daily trucks for 300,000 people. It is almost no aid at all.

&gt; The U.N. and its aid partners have the use of the Rafah border crossing from Egypt into Gaza, which is primarily a pedestrian crossing, and cannot handle the volume of trucks that need to enter the territory, causing large backlogs.  

&gt; Israel allowed the opening of the Kerem Shalom [Karem Abu Salem, in Arabic] crossing one month ago for humanitarians, but the U.N. says its use fluctuates depending on the security situation.  

&gt; The aid chiefs say they need Israeli authorization to use a working port close to Gaza and border crossing points into the northern part of Gaza. They say access to Ashdod port, some 40 kilometers to the north, would facilitate significantly larger quantities of aid to be shipped in which they would then move by truck to northern Gaza. Despite Israeli evacuation orders, around 300,000 Palestinians remain in the north, and few convoys have been able to reach them.

279,"&gt;did anyone technically own the land I mean itâs swapped âownershipâ dozens of times over many years.

It hasn't swapped ownership as many times as you may think.  There were the Jews and the Romans, but then a succession of Arabs for quite some time until the Ottomans showed up.  The British didn't ""own"" it, so much as they just administrated an ungoverned space while people figured things out. Both the Jews and the Arabs have inhabited the land for 2000 years.

&gt; Was Palestine ever its own country/nation ? 

No.  It was not.

&gt;I know in recent times the land was controlled by the ottomans and then the Britishâs. over the last 100 years are both sides to blame?

Most of the arguments on this sub are over which side is to blame and which side bears more blame than the other.  It will suffice to say that both sides have played their part, but Israeli violence and security measures tend to happen in response to Palestinian terrorism.

&gt;Iâve heard that palestines have lost land/homes over the years to Israeli settlers and 

This is true.

&gt;they have no âfreedom of movementâ  

I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Gaza and the West Bank are under varying levels of control.  A Palestinian in Gaza could not just drive into Israel, because Gaza is not part of Israel and Israel has the right to its own borders.

If a Mexican has to ask permission to enter the USA, does that mean they have ""no freedom of movement?"" Or can we say that if they are crossing an international border they should at least ask permission to enter our country?  

&gt;At one point wasnât there two states for a time but then it fell a part because one side or the other disagreed with how the land was divided up by the British ?

No. There have been proposals and peace agreements over the years, but there have never actually been two states.  The Palestinian territories are basically an ungoverned space claimed by a terrorist organization. 

&gt;In terms of the last 4 months or how ever long this recent event has taken place is it a genocide?

No. There are many reasons to be concerned about the proportionality of the violence and Israel's targeting deserves to be questioned.  Most of the people who are saying this are using post-hoc reasoning.  Their argument is, ""The violence is terrible, therefore it must be genocide,"" when in reality it is comparable to any other war.

&gt;People say itâs a genocide because Israel is attacking a people with no army ? Is that true because Iâve heard people say that Hamas is their army? 

This is the problem I was talking about before.  Is Gaza a separate country?  Is Hamas the government of Gaza?  Is Hamas an army?  If Hamas is not an army, where are the guns, rockets, and tunnels coming from?  

And additionally, has the presence or absence of an army ever been a criteria to declare something a genocide?  Even a quick glance at a history book suggests many wars have been fought against terrorist groups without automatically being labeled ""genocide."" 

(You will find a lot of people just take the word ""genocide"" and then make up whatever criteria or definition they want.)

&gt;Iâve heard people say itâs genocide because Israel could just send the infantry to go door to door to get Hamas without hurting civilians but from a military aspect that puts Israelâs troops more at a disadvantage/puts the troops in harms way more.

Then these people are idiots who have never fought a war, much less a counterinsurgency.  It will suffice to say that just ""going door to door"" as if they are selling girl scout cookies would not be an effective strategy.

&gt;Iâve heard people say thatâs itâs not a genocide based on if it was Israel would do it systematically by going into Gaza and the West Bank and throughout Israel killing everyone of Palestine descent like how the nazi-Germans did the the Jews in ww2.

This is my position.  When the Israelis are literally executing people by the dozen and kicking them into trenches, THEN I will believe it is a genocide.  In fact, I've seen the opposite. For example:  I've seen lots of people claim Israel is committing genocide by starving the Palestinians...  But they are still allowing food convoys into the country.  Just today there was an incident of mob violence when a convoy arrived.

It doesn't pass the most basic scrutiny:  If the goal is to exterminate people through starvation, why are they allowing food trucks to enter?  If the goal is to kill as many people as possible, why are the Israelis warning them to evacuate?  It just doesn't make sense to me.  

&gt; Iâm assuming thereâs really no validity on these based on there doesnât seem to be a general standard for measuring this. 

This is correct.  Genocide appears to mean whatever people want it mean, and they perform any mental gymnastics necessary to get there. 

I've had people tell me that it is ""genocide"" because 20,000 people have been killed.  The number is now something like 29,000.  Okay... Is that more than expected?  Is that less than usual? Is that average for a war? Did they just arbitrarily pick a number?  How many of those 29,000 are actual Hamas terrorists?  

We have no idea.  Plenty of people would like you to believe that all 29,000 people are innocent little babies, because that furthers their narrative. 

&gt; With the little amount of knowledge I have I feel like both sides are to blame not equal in blame but an unequal share of blame. I think one side has a majority share of blame and the other a minority share of blame vice versa.

289,"You seem to be assuming the Israeli goal is to make Palestinians like them. Or establish a situation where Palestinians like them in the future.Â 

The Israeli goal is simply stated. They want to break Hamas, and they want their hostages back.Â 

They may not succeed in breaking Hamas. Itâs a real option, especially if the leadership can run away to Egypt and come back later or something. But they *definitely* canât break Hamas if Hamas can just sit in rafah comfortably.Â 

They want their hostages back. Right now what Hamas wants in return is effectively Israeli surrender - letting thousands of terrorists go free (thatâs how we got sinwar), and leaving Gaza. This will then turn into an incredibly protracted negotiation for hostages like we are seeing now, because Hamas heads have no reason to believe they wonât survive if they donât make a deal.Â 

This war may or may not help Israelâs long term success. But this war is not about long term success. Itâs about assuring the Palestinians canât repeat 7/10, about breaking Hamas, and about bringing hostages home.Â 

You say Israel tried the occupation of Gaza already. Thatâs true. And things were *much* better during the occupation *for the Israelis*. Terrorism was aimed at soldiers for the most part. There werenât thousands of rockets being fired. There werenât tire burnings and field fire setting. If they wanted to pick up a terrorist theyâd just go and do it without having to bomb an apartment building. There werenât tunnels being built. Hamas didnât have any control.Â 

Once they left Gaza shit really hit the fan. More suicide bombings. Near daily until the wall went up. Then rockets, incendiary kites, runs on the border, 7/10. Tunnels, Hamas, Islamic jihad and much more became a problem.Â 

I donât want to see Gaza occupied as a matter of principle. Iâd much rather everyone govern their own selves. At the same time, I completely reject your argument that being in Gaza is bad for the Israelis beyond publicity. There are almost no rocket launches right now. If they go into rafah, Hamas wonât have any factories left and the majority of their infrastructure will be turned to pebbles.Â 

The other difference youâre missing is that the US is about what, 10,000 miles from Afghanistan? The taliban isnât about to kidnap Americans from Washington, and they canât launch rockets that far. America leaving Afghanistan doesnât leave them in a scenario where their capital city and largest city are a 2 hour drive from a place filled with Iranian weaponry. Itâs not a fair comparison. If Mexicoâs cartels killed 50,000 americans and kidnapped another 12,000 of them, Iâm *sure* Mexico would cease to exist as a country and America would occupy much more than a strip of land along the border.Â 

The Israelis know what they have to do. Thatâs what this article is about. The US can pressure them all they want, but theyâre not going to surrender to Hamas demands without trying to finish the war Hamas started.Â ",3/5/2024 17:48,Pro-Israel

305,"&gt;The young man smiling in this picture, his eyes half shut from the sun, is [Mordechai Ben-Uziyahu](https://imgur.com/a/O2RxDip). Itâs strange to call him my great uncle, since he died more than 40 years before I was born, and even my father rarely refers to him as an uncle. He was my grandmaâs younger brother, and he was a member of the pre-state Lehi paramilitary organization.  
&gt;  
&gt;This weekâs Israelâs memorial day commemorates many pre-state militia members like Mordechai ahead of Tuesdayâs celebration of Israelâs Independence Day. The two national holidays are joined on the calendar as a reminder that independence required heroic sacrifice. But Mordechaiâs story is also a reminder of the violence that went hand-in-hand with the creation of the state.  
&gt;  
&gt;During this same month, Palestinians commemorate Nakba Day, remembering the violent expulsion of their families. My relative Mordechai participated in the massacre of Palestinians at Deir Yassin, one of the most extreme of the atrocities committed during the Nakba and one of the most infamous acts of Zionist terrorism.  
&gt;  
&gt;How does one reconcile with having a terrorist in the family? Had he not been killed, would we sit by my grandma's table, sharing a tray of burekitas? What would I say to him? And how much of him is in us? For me, telling Mordechaiâs story is an important part of wrestling with our history.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mordechai was born in Komotini, northern Greece, to a Ladino-speaking Jewish family. The family immigrated to mandatory Palestine in the 1930s. They settled in Florentin, a bustling working class neighborhood in south Tel Aviv, where many migrant small business owners like themselves formed part of a diverse community.  
&gt;  
&gt;Three Jewish paramilitary organizations operated in Palestine at the time: The Hagana (âthe Defenceâ) was by far the largest and was composed mostly of members of the socialist agricultural settlements and socialist youth movements alumni. The Etzel (also known as Irgun; âNational Military Organizationâ) was a right wing, ultra-nationalist organization. In 1939, the Etzel was split: some members opposed the organizationâs support of the British colonizer during their war with the Nazis, and held that the fight against the British must continue even during WWII.  
&gt;  
&gt;The splinter group was named the Lehi (âFighters for the Freedom of Israelâ). The Lehi developed into a diverse group, composed of fascists as well as Marxists, with the binding element being a commitment to ruthless violent struggle, including terror attacks against civilians. While all Jewish paramilitaries executed acts of terrorism, for the Lehi it was a daily state of affairs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Like many pre-state Israeli teens, Mordechai joined a youth movement. Palestine-born kids from the kibbutzim and moshavim were likely to join the Zionist-socialist movements that were affiliated with the mainstream Zionist institutions and with the Hagana. Mordechai, like many first generation immigrants, was alienated from these movements, and joined another youth group, where he was recruited by the Lehi in the mid-40s. Was he an ideological extremist? Probably not. When my father interviewed his commander, and asked what was Mordechaiâs ideology, the commander said that Mordechai mostly listened.  
&gt;  
&gt;Starting by hanging posters and distributing flyers, he quickly rose in the ranks to become a soldier. He was given the codename Dror (âfreedomâ) and started to be involved in actions around Tel Aviv. As war broke out in 1947 he was transferred to Jerusalem. Mordechai spent the war in Jerusalem, fighting the Arab Legion and attacking local Palestinian civilians. He even devised a specific terrorism tactic: driving a truck up Jerusalemâs sloped streets and rolling a barrel filled with explosives through the back door, down the slope and into markets and crowds.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the Lehi website, he is commemorated as a bright, talented and humble young man. Attributed to him is participating in the planning on an attack of a Palestinian village near the city, though according to my dadâs research this is unlikely: he was not important enough to plan it, but he certainly participated. This village was Deir Yassin.  
&gt;  
&gt;On April 9, 1948, a combined force of Etzel and Lehi troops invaded the village, which had no strategic importance. They overpowered the villageâs small defence force and occupied it. What followed was the most extreme of the atrocities committed during the Nakba and one of the most infamous acts of Zionist terrorism. The Lehi and Etzel combatants massacred the villagers, captive soldiers and civilians, men women and children. The estimates of the numbers of people killed varies, and are likely somewhere between one and two hundred. Women were raped, property was pillaged, and survivors were expelled, never to return. It was a deliberate act of ethnic cleansing, aimed at terrorizing other Palestinians into escaping.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mordechai was killed soon after in a training accident, at the age of 22. The family knew that he was involved with the Lehi, but had no idea what he was doing. His mother never recovered. My dad tells of his grandmother as a woman who lost interest in the living, never living her house and rarely talking. The family was broken forever.

That's it. That's how he died.

Perhaps such a mundane end was more fitting. Lehi's ""Dror Camp"" was named after Mordechai's Lehi alias, established on June 6, 1948, at the center of Talbiyeh neighborhood. In fact, there is a memorial at the camp. The memorial honors five Lehi members who accidentally blew themselves up while taking apart artillery shells on July 25, 1948. Amongst the dead was 23-year-old David Schneiweis, another participant in the Deir Yassin massacre.

&gt;Mordechai Ben-Uziyahuâs name was read every year in my school, his school. The Lehi and Etzelâs commanders have streets and squares named after them. Nobody was arrested for the massacre of Deir Yassin, but the survivors and their descendants are still not allowed to return.  
&gt;  
&gt;For those of us who dare to look at history with open eyes, the conjoined dates force us to reflect on the difficult truths of our personal loss. Many Israelis, perhaps the majority of us, have a family history of terrorism, ethnic cleansing and other war crimes. Many fallen heroes are murderers. But that doesnât mean we need to forget them.

It's not exactly humanitarian, though. I know that was not the question you were answering but these eternally peeves me off whenever you see how coldly Israel justifies vicious attacks. 

And don't tell me that humanity does not matter in such a messy conflict. Every Israeli plea for support after October 7th was based on trying to reason with everyone's humanitarian impulses at the sight of innocent Israelis being massacred by vicious terrorists. Every day since then Israel has compared it to the Holocaust, to reason with people of the innocent Israelis that were killed. Israelis said that every life matters and that Hamas violated it. All genuinely good arguments.

Then they turn around the next day and violate the sanctity of life multiple times over and throw it off as ""game-theory"". Because Palestinian life is not equal to that of an Israeli.

&gt; Hitting back hard was the right move

What makes you think other people do not think the same way? The entire Hamas terrorist calculus is that it must hit on Israel so hard that they give in to their demands, which is why they took innocent hostages to force their demands. Hamas spokespersons have coldly said that all Israelis are legitimate targets. But you Israelis are no different from Hamas. You also believe in simply hitting back hard. You don't care of the absolute rubble that Gaza has been left it in, of the psychological scarring of destroyed homes.

6,000 killed Oct.-Feb. (Averages 1,500 per month)

3,000 killed Feb.-Apr.

= 9,000 Hamas militants killed Oct. - Apr.

We can expect Hamas figures to be massively down played for many obvious reasons. But even with Hamasâ own figures, that means 1/3 of the deaths have been Hamas militants. 

A 1:2 combatant-civilian ratio is very normal for war, and incredibly low for urban warfare in one of the most densely populated places a war has ever been fought in.

320,"If it alright my comment is mainly going to be clarifying questions since you put a really large number of things in a single post, so you had to be relatively short and I think a lot of things are unclear.

You seem to be sincere and honest about trying to learn things. So I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but your whole approach to the conflict and learning about it seems extremely biased- though in ways that you didn't intend. First, your understanding and position was founded on knowing a lot of Jews. Then, presumably because you're a sincere and open minded person, you decided to take a look and see if you were biased. But that doesn't mean you learned about the conflict objectively, it just means you read some new sources from the stance of ""lets debunk my previous bias"". That's just a new slant coloring your views and learning process. Two biases don't make for an objective picture. And here its certainly a problem because first you learned no facts, you based things on emotion. And then you learned facts specifically to debunk your emotions. If you had been well informed when you were pro-Israel that would have balanced learning things contrary to your narrative. Instead, this is a fight between emotion and fact for you- which obviously isn't a correct way to look a things. There are facts and emotions to support both sides, its a complicated issue.

&gt;There was a definite point that I as a former vet thought that the bombing would surely end

Are you saying as a former vet you felt qualified to analyze when the bombing should have stopped?

&gt; Knowing about our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that was completely foreign to me. There was a clear difference between the US and how it conducts war (even when we are being completely f'd up) and what was happening in Gaza.

Can you explain where or when in US operations you feel there was a similar situation to Gaza? Because from my very basic understanding it doesn't seem the US ever had to deal with  a situation where if they sent humanitarian aid or allowed humanitarian aid it would be fully controlled by the enemy they were fighting instead of going to the civilians in the war zone?

&gt;It's apartheid

In what way is apartheid different than occupation in your mind? Lots of people seem to use the word differently. To clarify my question: all Israeli citizens, regardless of race/ethnicity, are treated the same in the West Bank. All Palestinians are treated differently. And Israel had no internal control of Gaza so in what sense was it apartheid.

&gt;I promise you no Westerner would accept living as a West Banker or Gazan

Nobody would accept living under occupation, I don't think anyone denies that conditions are bad. But that doesn't really seem to have to do with being pro, or anti Israel?

&gt;The ""offers of a state"" were not all good offers, some were clear insults. 

Why does that matter? There have been endless talks for over 80 years....if you think as a general principle Israel was dishonest and never sought peace, I understand the point. If that isn't what you are saying, what is your point?

&gt;Everything done and being accused of being done by Hamas has been done by early Zionist terror groups like Lehi, Irgun, and lesser degree Haganah. 

Again, what's your point? Is this something that made you pro or anti Israel?

&gt;Israel getting what it wanted was greatly due to terrorism

I think this is very inaccurate. But I don't even have a clarifying question because whatever you were thinking here probably would fill another post so I can't even open it in a comment we're I'm already asking you about everything else.

&gt;Early Zionism had multiple different ideas of what Zionism meant. A healthy chunk of Zionist didn't want to establish a state in the European sense, they were content with living amongst the locals and integrating into the existing culture.

True. Again, did this make you pro or anti Israel? Also, what is your understanding of why that healthy chunk of Zionists disappeared and a state ended up forming?

Can you please provide some sources for number 7? I can provide sources of evidence of oppression, racism and xenophobia of Arabs against Jews, etc....you seem to have read a very different version of history than I have.

&gt;In the display, âPalestineâ was described as covering the entirety of Israel and the Temple Mount was depicted with a huge Palestinian Flag. The explanation for one plate says: âFishing with nets is one of the oldest industries in Palestine. The shoreline stretches for 224 km from Rafah in the south to Raâas al Naqoura in the North.â Raâas al Naqoura is the Arabic name for Rosh HaNikra, an international border crossing between Israel and Lebanon in the North. Rafah is the border town with Egypt, in the South of Gaza. Thus the existence of Israel is denied and âPalestineâ is regarded as covering the entirety of Israel.

&gt;âThe olive branch is the symbol of peace and is used to express the wish for an independent Palestinian stateâ. However, the picture on the plate accompanying the text shows the Dome of the Rock with a large Palestinian flag, implying that Jerusalem and in particular the site of what had been the Jewish Temple, would be part of a Palestinian state. The Temple Mount is the holiest place in Judaism and it is offensive for many Jewish people to see a Palestinian flag over their holiest site.



These are clear expressions of co-existance, and make references to areas that their grand parents and great grand parents once consider their homes. 

For crying out loud, the olive branch is a gesture of peace when two entities are in conflict. And people still claim it was a call to genocide.

332,"*Following US pressure, Israel will be sending a delegation to Cairo on Tuesday for talks on a framework that will see the release of hostages and achieve an extended pause, according to Hebrew media reports.*

*Senior officials from the United States, Egypt, and Qatar are expected in the Egyptian capital to resume negotiations on the three-phase deal, sources familiar with the matter said.*

*The framework was hammered out in Paris last month by CIA Director Bill Burns, his Israeli counterpart David Barnea of the Mossad, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani, who also serves as foreign minister, and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel.*

*It reportedly envisions a three-phase humanitarian pause â with 35 to 40 Israeli hostages, including women, men over the age of 60 and those with serious medical conditions, released during the first six-week phase. Israeli soldiers and the bodies of killed hostages would be released in the second and third phases. Details regarding the latter phases, as well as the number and identities of Palestinian security prisoners who would be released by Israel, were to be discussed in subsequent negotiations if the sides both agreed to the Paris proposal. Other reports presented different versions of the framework, which has not been officially published.*

*Israel has waffled on sending representatives to the Cairo talks this week after Hamas offered a counterproposal that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called âdelusional.â The Palestinian terror groupâs demands include a permanent ceasefire, a withdrawal of troops from Gaza, reconstruction of the enclave, and some 1,500 Palestinian prisoners, among them terror masterminds, in exchange for the remaining hostages taken on October 7.*

*But top officials from the United States have said that, regardless of some of the ânonstarters,â there is space to push for an agreement and that it was Washingtonâs intention to do so.*

*In a call on Sunday between US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu, Biden reportedly encouraged the Israeli premier to send a delegation to Cairo to join the talks.*

*Barnea, along with Shin Bet head Ronen Bar and Nitzan Alon, who is commanding intelligence efforts to find the abductees, will lead the delegation, Channel 12 reported.*

*Biden said on Monday that the US was pushing for a six-week pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas as a stepping stone toward a longer ceasefire.*

*Speaking after meeting with Jordanâs King Abdullah at the White House, the US president said the hostage deal framework he helped craft with Egyptian and Qatari mediators would see a humanitarian pause of at least six weeks, âwhich we could then [use] to build something more enduring.â He added that key elements were in place but âgapsâ remained.*

*He said he has encouraged Israeli leaders to âto keep working to achieve the dealâ despite the rejection of Hamasâs demands.*

*Biden, who has shown increasing frustration with Netanyahu for not heeding his advice, said Washington was working with allies in the region on a deal âto find the means to bring all the hostages home, to ease the humanitarian crisis, to end the terror threat and to bring peace to Gaza and Israel through a two-state solution.â*

*Israel has been willing to accept talks based on the original Paris framework, which reportedly envisions a three-phase humanitarian pause, with 35 to 40 Israeli hostages â women, men older than 60 and those with serious medical conditions â released during the first six-week phase. Israeli soldiers and the bodies of killed hostages would be released in the second and third phases.*

*Details regarding the latter phases, as well as the number and identities of Palestinian security prisoners who would be released by Israel, were to be discussed in subsequent negotiations if the sides both agreed to the Paris proposal. Other reports presented different versions of the framework, which has not been officially published.*

*The negotiations in Cairo on Tuesday will come as Israel is preparing an offensive on Rafah â Gazaâs southernmost city and the last Hamas stronghold in the enclave â and amid mounting concerns that such a move could derail the hostage talks as Hamas.*

*The US has voiced its opposition to the operation without a âcredibleâ plan to protect some 1 million civilians who have sought refuge there from months of Israeli bombardment.*

*Biden reiterated those concerns Monday in the statement alongside Abdullah, saying that no Israeli military operation should move forward in Rafah âwithout a credible plan for ensuring the safety and supportâ of civilians there.*

*âWeâve also been clear from the start that we oppose any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza,â Biden said.*

*Netanyahu has said Israel was working on a plan to ensure âsafe passageâ for civilians in Rafah.*

*In his remarks Tuesday, Biden said the US shares Israelâs goal of defeating Hamas, whose terrorists hide in tunnels beneath civilian infrastructure, âincluding schools, playgrounds and neighborhoodsâ but also acknowledges that the Palestinian people âhave also suffered unimaginable pain and loss.â*

*In some four months of war, more than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. These figures cannot be independently verified, are believed to include fatalities caused by failed rocket fire by Gaza terror groups, and do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.*

*Israel says it has killed 10,000 Hamas gunmen in Gaza, as well as 1,000 terrorists in Israel on October 7 when thousands rampaged through southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages.*

*It is believed that 130 hostages remain in Gaza â not all of them alive â after 105 civilians were released from Hamas captivity during a weeklong truce in late November, and four hostages were released prior to that.*

*Three hostages have been rescued by troops alive, and the bodies of 11 hostages have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the military. The IDF has confirmed the deaths of 29 of those still held by Hamas, citing new intelligence and findings obtained by troops operating in Gaza.*

*One more person is listed as missing since October 7, and their fate is still unknown.*

*Hamas is also holding the bodies of fallen IDF soldiers Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin since 2014, as well as two Israeli civilians, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who are both thought to be alive after entering the Strip of their own accord in 2014 and 2015 respectively.*",2/13/2024 21:44,Neutral

337,"1. The only negotiation that worked out was at the beginning most likely as a PR stunt by Hamas.

Weâve seen Hamas come to the negotiation table more now in this situation and the IDF has found evidence of potential hostages being alive  as theyâve pushed. This is the only way 

2. Think of it like ISIS. Hamas will not have the capability to do anything like Oct 7th ever again and more likely will lead to some other group (hopefully better) taking charge. It does not matter if their leaders are not in Gaza if they donât have infrastructure, people, weapons and leadership on the ground they canât do anything. Most likely the leaders will be taken out by Mossad and is why we see them scrambling.

People hate Jews so they hate Israel. Israel criticism is fine and because itâs a democracy it can change for the better but to say it should be destroyed and become a one state solution after people were just terrorized,murdered,raped and kidnapped is a joke.

5. Most of the people are not against those wars and never cared until Israel was involved. Purely because they hate Israel maybe cause they are antisemitic or maybe itâs because Palestinians werenât able to conjoin Jordan with Israel like they wanted and now spread misinformation like it was stolen from them when it was legally split then they lost the land they forfeited after declaring a war and losing. Sorry but there is consequences to wars.

6. The west is sort of safe right now for Jewish people. But if you speak to any Jewish person they are afraid because of the aggression and violence and antisemitism pretty clearly aimed at synagogues and Holocaust memorials and anything Jewish related. We saw a women raped in France and Jewish businesses attacked. This is not about the conflict this is hatred. The Holocaust didnât just happen overnight it was gradual. It can be said this is still possible. Hate crimes towards Jews are like 300% up and account for a majority of hate crimes when the Jewish population is a minority in most places

7. The Nakba is the story of how Palestinians  lost the war they declared which promised to wipe the Jews out in genocide and ethnic cleansing. If you declare a war and lose you canât cry about what you lose. Thatâs how it  goes. Anyone saying otherwise is a clown

8. Solution is a Palestinian leader stops the pay for slay program, deradicalizes Palestinians and stops making them martyrs. Then we can move forward

9. No they are all Palestinians 

10. Palestinians population has only grown since Israelâs existence so none of that is true. Nobody knows what would happen if Jewish people became a minority the goal is that it never happens because if Palestinians had the chance to render Israel weak and destroyed they would  at this point 

11. Israelâs retaliation will lead to stability. As it always has. They end up having peace with those who cooperate like Egypt and Jordan. Egypt and jordan has helped Israel during this conflict plenty of times. Palestinians could see the same situation if they stopped committing terrorism. Palestinians can hate Israel all they want but then they should get better leadership who wants peace then they wouldnât have curfew and be in this situation

The UN simply revised its casualty breakdown based on updated information from the Health Ministry's own published data, which clarified that a portion of the deaths have not yet been independently identified. The overall fatality count remains unchanged; the UN is simply awaiting independent confirmation of 10,000 deaths before providing more specific details about the victims, such as age or gender.

Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-six-week-drive-hit-hamas-rafah-scale-back-war-2024-02-19/) today that

&gt;A Hamas official based in Qatar told Reuters that the group estimated it had lost 6,000 fighters during the four-month-old conflict, half the 12,000 Israel says it has killed.

This is the first time during the conflict that Hamas openly admitted to any losses among its troops.

&gt;When settlers kill in the WestBank, isn't it merely out of hate? Or is it to achieve political aims through violence? Because that's how I understand terrorism. 

What? Yes, its to achieve a goal. They want to *settle* that place and need to displace arabs there. Its like the whole point. You seriously should look at the history of the conflict because the fact that you dont know a thing about these settlements means you have absolutely no idea about this conflict. And i dont mean this in an offensive way, vut thats a fact. Thats an essential part of whats happening there.


And even if it wasnt, thats just semantics. Noone cares why they kill arabs there. They kill them, thats it.


&gt;And in terms of sadistic brutality (rape of men and women, murder of children, torture, removing limbs etc.) I doubt radical Jews reach that level of barbarism.   
&gt;(I know that redical Jews exist, and if I rememer right, it was one of the right-wing radical Jews who killed Rabin). I disagree strongy to compare these atrocities. 


You doubt that based on what? Do you believe someone whos father got killed by settlers tells himself 'yeah but hamas raped people'


But yes, settlers absolutely have raped arabs in the westbank in the past and have murdered children. I'm seriously baffled why you believe they didnt and start ro doubt if youre actually interested in learning about this conflict. 

Yes. Israelis have done all of these things, too.

&gt;I will read about Ben Gvir, thanks for the suggestion. He's in power since December 2022, So I wonder, If you don't overestimate his relevance in this.... lol  


Look, i'm a bit tired because you keep on reading about this on the most superficial level possible and these are things you should have known when you started to read into this conflict.


Ben gvir doesnt just pop out of nowhere. Hes a big name who has defended jewish settlers that killed arabs and justifies the settlements and murderers with religion. He represents the settlers, and therr are between *400.000* and *700.000* settlers in
Illegal settlements. Thats between 10 and 20% of all of israels population.

Losing these settlements (as humanitarian law, the USA and EU demands) means all of these people would have to move. So yes, the settlermovement has immense power in israel and ben gvir has become the spokesperson for them.

&gt;Again, I will write it again: It's not because of radical Jews or Christians that we have strict Airport Security. So yeah, number wise and in it's force, I see political Islam as the worlds problem.   

It wasnt hamas that did 9/11 and it was, in fact, the USA that [helped radical islam become a thing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone).


Abd yes, bush justified his invasion of iraq as 'god given right' and called it a crusade. So while the west doesnt have 'stricter laws because of christians' george w bush used christianity to justify the invasion of afghanistan, leading to hundreds of thousand dead afghans that had nothing to with 9/11.



&gt;""Mowing the Lawn"" refers to the Gaza-Strip. I don't feel entitled to have an opinion on this strategy, as a non middle-eastern military expert. As far as I've read it, there was hope that due to that strategy military motivation will decrease. Guess that failed.


The ones that coined that term justified it by saying 'we hope to get rid of hamas', but military experts and human rights advocates have criticized that tactic since it was named.

&gt;Also, there are plenty Arab-Israelis, you mean Palestinian an Israeli Deaths.   

Obviously.



&gt;I didn't ask for it. But in your case, I'm quite happy. You gave some interesting insights and didn't scream in my face ""what about the dead children though"". So thank you.

Sadly, and ironically, you said 'what about the children hamas killed, jews didnt do that (i think)'.

Yes, these dead children matter, but theyre not important to the discusion here.


&gt;That is what's happening, isn't it? They get rid of Hamas.   
Netanjahu will fall after that, as far as I am informed. No? Ultimately, it seems clear that he won't stay in power for too long anymore. 


No, its not. Whats happening right now has happened in the past. This is just another episode of the gaza conflict and unless some major change happens, it will happen again in 10 years.

Maybe he has to go, maybe he doesnt. But its not just netanyahu. Its not even just his party. Israel has a big divide where half of the population is borderline fascist and the other half is extremely welcoming and liberal. But the extremist jews are the ones winning in the long run because they have more children and are more willing to abuse political power.

&gt;What worries me here, is if it will be possible to denazify the Palestinians. Because of Islam, it seems like this process won't be as easy to achieve as in Germany after WW2. 

I'm german and my grandparents were really antisemitic because they were raised in the hitler youth. Didnt matter because germany was forced to change *and built up*. Many Israelis dont want to build up palestine, though.


The problem isnt islam in gaza. Its the history of the region and the conflict, which is why *context matters*.

Try telling an gazan child whose parents and sister got blown into pieces in front of him that he has to be friends with israel now.


Ir try to tell a child whose parents were killed and raped on oct. 7th that palestine will now become a country.


Both of these kids arent at fault for any of this, but both have to deal with the fact that this slaughter has to stop on both sites and for that, they need to come to terms. Germany and poland/france were able to, too.



&gt;Excuse me? The last part is unclear to me. As I see it: Right now, Israel is in the phase of getting rid of Hamas (and getting back the hostages). no?   

No. You cant get rid of hamas by bombing them. We have seen that in afghanistan. Because with every terrorist killed, you kill at least double the amount of innocents, too. These innocents have family that will hate the party that killed their family and become terrorists themselves.


&gt;And for the second part of the operation - the denazification. I assume, the Israeli Intelligence will have a plan for this. But anyway, right now, the phase is ""getting rid of hamas"".   


No, they dont. You believe that because you view israel as the good guys, but their government isnt. Peace with palestine means to netanyahu, he loses his biggest argument for voters because hes running 'as the security guy' for israel.

&gt;What I worry is: Turkey f.e. said, they will offer Hamas Terrorist Shelter. The EU is failing atm, but the soon incoming corrective right-swing, will most likely deal with that issue.

394,"&gt;Can Israel just BRIBE Egypt to retake responsibility for Gaza?

There are many issues

1. Israel is not going to pay 24 billion or whatever to Egypt to retake Gaza. They might not have a spare 24 billion lying around somewhereâ¦but more importantly, it goes against their personal trait. The Israeli people will be strongly against it, having to bare the cost.

2. Israel doesnt trust others/outsiders when it comes to the security of their country. Bribring Egypt to retake responsibility for Gaza will also mean outsourcing the security of Israel on her southern borders to Egypt, a military ally/partner perhaps but still an outsider nonetheless. 

3. The genie is already out of the bottle. I dont think âPalestinian nationalismâ will die out just because they will be ruled by a new Egyptian Arab Muslim master. I suspect the âPalestinian resistant movementâ would continueâ¦a bit like Kurds (muslims) against Syria / Turkey (also muslims), Hezbollah vs Lebanon (Arab vs Arab)â¦but the optics on world media wont look so badâ¦. the world wont take notice when Arab kills Arabs or Muslims kills Muslims like the Yemen war, Kurds, Iran vs Iraq, Sudan civil war, etcâ¦

4. That still leaves the West Bank ? West Bank will still be a problem. Hezbollah will still be a problemâ¦. bribing Egypt to retake Gaza wont end all of Israel security concerns. The problem still persist, even after thatâs after paying 24 billion. The Israeli people wont like it. 

5. Egypt wont willingly want to be sucked in deeper into this conflict. In a sense Egypt under Sisi has been bribed to cooperate with Israel to control the Rafah border (monitoring the goods and people going in/out of Gaza). The Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas are no friend of Sisi, but still there are hundreds of smuggling tunnels under the Rafah border. Judging by the constant firing of Hamas rockets into Israel, there are many illegal arms which had entered Gaza. Egypt cant even prevent illegal arms getting into Gaza, how is Israel suppose to trust Egypt being responsibile for Gaza to prevent any attacks on Israel ?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For years, the various governments led by Benjamin Netanyahu took an approach that divided power between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank â bringing Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to his knees while making moves that propped up the Hamas terror group.  
&gt;  
&gt;The idea was to prevent Abbas â or anyone else in the Palestinian Authorityâs West Bank government â from advancing toward the establishment of a Palestinian state.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus, amid this bid to impair Abbas, Hamas was upgraded from a mere terror group to an organization with which Israel held indirect negotiations via Egypt, and one that was allowed to receive infusions of cash from abroad.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Most of the time, Israeli policy was to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset. Far-right MK Bezalel Smotrich, now the finance minister in the hardline government and leader of the Religious Zionism party, said so himself in 2015.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to various reports, Netanyahu made a similar point at a Likud faction meeting in early 2019, when he was quoted as saying that those who oppose a Palestinian state should support the transfer of funds to Gaza, because maintaining the separation between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza would prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.  
&gt;  
&gt;While Netanyahu does not make these kind of statements publicly or officially, his words are in line with the policy that he implemented.

&amp;#x200B;

406,"Part  1/2

&gt;The war started long before the Arabs rejected the UN partition plan . It started as a civil war in Mandatory Palestine in 1947 due to violence between Jews and Arabs.

False, the partition plan was suggested at 1947 (29 November) and the civil war started a day after. 

It's true the 2 groups had tension between them before but the civil war officially started only after the partition plan was refused. 

&gt;Plus, are you forgetting the Nakba where 750 000 Palestinians were expelled?

The war was an all-or-noting war the Palestinians started, if they were to win the Jewish people would have been murdered and expelled from their homes and that's not a guess but a fact. That was the point of all-or-noting wars. 

Despite that btw Israel still gave citizenship to the Arabs that remained within its borders.

&gt; Plan Dalet which called for an expansion of Israel outside of the UN partition plan which lead to the expulsion of more Palestinians?

First of all the plan was not a general Israeli plan as during that time Israel was split into multiple different defense groups but regardless of that, the plan was only offered AFTER the Palestinians rejected the UN plan so the partition plan was no longer relevant regardless.

&gt; Or the destruction of numerous Palestinian villages by the IDF in 1948 where most Israeli cities are now built on top of their remains? Or the numerous massacres by the IDF in 1948 like Deir Yassin, Tantura,Abu Shusha, Sa'Sa, Safsaf, Lydda, Al-Dawayima and many more massacres of Arabs by the IDF?

Again, an all or noting war. You can't claim it's fine for the Palestinians to bring outside help in form of at least 6 different states to attack a new state, attempt to conquer it all and kill and/or expel all the Jewish people inside of it but then blame Israel for doing the same because that's just hypocritic...

Israel was a new independent state surrounded by enemies from every direction. They didn't have a real chance of survival without going full force. 

Does it mean it was morally fine? No. But it's also not like they could have done things differently and survive.

&gt;And led to the expelling and exodus of another 250 000 Palestinians which is now called the Naksa. Additionally, are we forgetting the 1956 war which saw Israel also commit atrocities like the continued displacement of Palestinians until 1956 even after the Nakba. Plus, more massacres by the IDF like Rafah, Khan Yunis and Kafr Qassim in 1956?  


Those people that were expelled belonged to Egypt and Jordan before Israel got the territory from both (by got I mean Egypt &amp; Jordan both refused to take the territories back). 

I do want to believe it's only fair to return the people back to their states and not annex the people as well.

again - might just be me but I don't see any reason to give both people and territories... If you give someone a territory you should take your people back just like happened in pretty much any other case.

As for 1956 war, irrelevant as wars get civilians killed. There's a massive difference between targeting civilians specifically to civilians getting killed during a war between the armies. 

Rafah - Indeed happened after the city was already captured but only 48-111 people died and it was the result of the civilians rioting which included an attack of an UNRA building. And obviously if people riot and start attacking soldiers, self defense is only fair.

Khan Yunis - War casualties. Civilians died during the war between Israel to Egypt. It was not a situation where Israeli soldiers entered free and just killed people if that's what you're trying to claim.

Kafr Qassim - It was indeed a problematic event but 

1. it was causes by a misunderstanding (The message about the curfew and the starting time of the curfew itself were changed) and 

2. Out of 8 commanders who got the problematic command of shooting the people who stayed outside their houses during the curfew, only 1 actually followed through. It doesn't justify the things but it also shows the event was much less problematic than it could have been.

&gt; How? The agreement also stipulated that Israel would halt the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank which Israel did not abide to. In fact, Israel increased settler populations and settlements in the West Bank after 1993 shown here on this graph (blue line).

The *current deal* is to release *some* civilian women and children from Hamas's captivity. In exchange, it was agreed that Israel will release 3 times more of detained/convicted women and children from its prisons.

Perhaps, eventually, mediators can work with Hamas to release *all* civilian women and children (Hamas says they need time to ascertain where hostages are and who is actually holding them). It is roughly estimated that total number could be about 100. So, Israel prepared list of 300 Palestinians (women and children) it could release in exchange.

Even if so, there are still men and soldiers (it's not clear whether Hamas differentiates between civilian men and soldiers). Hamas said many times publicly that it would only agree to release soldiers in exchange for release of *all* Hamas prisoners in Israel's jails (not sure whether they will also insist on non-Hamas terrorists, they might).

Buzzword garbage. Israel is far more accommodating of Arabs than Arabs are of Jew, it's why there are basically ZERO Jews in any Arab land whilst Israel is 20% Arab. Do you people ever stop projecting your own racism onto the Jews?

&gt; They have literally been instructing the soldiers to commit genocide. Zionists very often say things like ""Death to Arabs!""

They want to annihilate hamas, ""muh literal genocide instruction"". No Zionists do not often say things like ""Death to Arabs"", some football hooligans do. Dehumanisation and calls for death of the Jews is mainstream in the Arab world.

&gt; Israel considers itself ""God's chosen people,"" pretty similar to the Nazi's ""master race.""

The numbers commonly cited by media are what we get out of the ""official"" reporting systems of the Hamas controlled Palestinian Health System. That means usually people that died in a hospital or were delivered to an official morgue and then registered there.

Gaza is now cut into three pockets with most of the population crammed to the Egyptian border and most hospitals shut down. Even communication problems will prevent enough casualties from being reported to the official channels.

Then there is the obvious point that Hamas will not report their fighters killed in an air strike in Gaza City to a hospital somewhere in Rafah. Not only do they have no interest in announcing: ""By the way the Israelis killed 150 fighters over night"" they likely don't even know what's happening to them. On the other side even if you, a Palestinian terrorist, survive an air strike, nobody is coming for you. Ambulances can't just show up and pick up a fighter and even if another fighter can get you to safety medical care will be non existent or very basic. 

The Israelis estimate that they killed around 7.000 fighters. There is no logical way to get those numbers into the 20.000 commonly cited. It just doesn't work out. 

Also last point: Somebody checked the history of deaths and over the last weeks the percentage of women and children killed was expanding. Why could that be during the most intensive fighting?

441,"I thought about that many times, and I have understood it like this: 

- Israel has the most technologically advanced army, but technology in war hasnât made ultra big advancements in precision. Drones are cool but they cannot do so well in an urban territory. Israel has no Yonduâs Arrow, no Super Jewish Space Lasers, no Iron Man suits. They have bombs, good intelligence and good strategists.

- This said, Israel hasnât the most numerous army in the world. They need tactical advantage since they havenât strength in numbers and anyway cannot afford to lose so many men in long and pointless fights. Remember what the problem was in WW1? The trench battles. 
Urban battlefield is basically a âverticalizedâtrench, very advantageous for Hamas, since they are using guerrilla tactics. 
IDF soldiers donât know very well Gazaâs territory as much as Hamas, and need to use drones to scan the area in search for info. If the IDF were to use only foot-soldiers and special forces, they would have been killed 10 times more by Hamasâ fighters. 

- This is why they bomb:
They need tactical advantage with a good risk/reward ratio, in order to lose the least amount of men possible while fighting Hamas.
They need to make sure the battlefield becomes less of an advantage to the enemy, so that Hamas canât move around as safely or as easily using tunnels for example, or so that they cannot hide as easily . They need to dismantle Hamasâ military bases, and those are many buildings in Gaza (Hospitals, Mosques, Churches, UN buildings, Schools, means of transportation) used to store missiles, explosives, weapons, and used as active shelters from which Hamas terrorists shoot rockets and bullets. 

In conclusion, they bomb: 

- To have tactical advantage in an area that otherwise would be too dangerous for foot-soldiers and would make the war frustratingly longer.

- To make the battlefield less usable in the enemy.âs tactics, removing some of the advantages Hamas have in this war.

- To destroy the enemyâs weapon storage and power positions.

Gaza is facing famine, its hospitals are besieged, threats of ground invasion in Rafah loom near, and Israel continues its onslaught on the over 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

With growing internal divisions and heightened political pressure on Israel and the United States, itâs time to push even harder. Our mobilizations at this moment can be more decisive than ever, and we must show our full strength now to ensure a lasting ceasefire and an end to the siege on Gaza.

Act now, and mobilize in your communities and institutions. Everyone must be on the streets on March 2nd! All out for Rafah! All out for Gaza! Stop the genocide!

Frankly, Iâm not sure why she is going up there either but it was her home. I donât know anywhere that is any safer..

Iâd also like to emphasize that Israel still had complete control over Palestine, including checkpoints and border control, etc but no, I donât think it was nearly what it is today.

In the 11 years leading up to the creation of the state of Israel in Palestine in 1948, Zionist extremists who lived in the territory of Palestine under the British Mandate used terrorism as a military strategy to accelerate the establishment of an independent Jewish state. Their violence was directed against the British authorities who governed Palestine and against the Palestinian indigenous population throughout Palestine. Over 57 violent attacks were carried out by Zionist terrorist groups (e.g. Haganah, Lehi, Irgun
â ultra-nationalist groups from the far right wing of the Revisionist Zionist movement) killing over 5,000 Palestinians and dozens of British.While Zionist terrorist groups assassinated UN personnel, murdered British officers and attacked British military headquarters to overthrow the Mandate, they terrorized Palestinian inhabitants in order to provoke mass flight, displacement and migration.",12/17/2023 0:56,Pro-Palestine

Other than a nice idea that Palestinians should have a country, recognising it *right now* while Hamas support in WB and Gaza are off the charts, after the worst terror attack known to Israel. Thatâs just rewarding terrorism and hold no weight in reality.

Edit to add source for PA elections

Palestinians have not held a national election since the Hamas terror group won a landslide victory in the Palestinian legislature in 2006.

Despite numerous promises by the Palestinian leadership to hold another national vote, PA President Mahmoud Abbas indefinitely delayed the last planned election in 2021. Abbas blamed Israel, but most observers say he sought to avoid a humiliating loss to rivals within his own Fatah party, as well as to Hamas.

484,"I think that to truly answer this question it requires a much deeper ethnographic and historical understanding of Palestinian culture. Itâs very easy to point fingers at all of the wrongs committed by both sides over the course of time, but those are effects and not causes to a much bigger problem. 

Itâs very easy to apply armchair theorizing about colonialist oppressor/victim relationships from a western perspective. However, that completely fails to take into account how different eastern logic is from western (neither is better, theyâre just different) and the humanity and complexity of the situation for all of those involved. 

It takes away Palestinian agency and promotes the world to see them as incapable of anything other than being taken advantage of by an âoppressor,â which in a way is incredibly condescending and insulting to them as a people. Itâs even easier to do this philosophy from the safety of the west by a bunch of people who have no concept of what itâs like to be under the threat of regular bombings or the experience of war and how it affects civilian and soldiers alike. 

Iâm only starting my journey of understanding all of this as a Jew by choice. However, I majored in anthropology so any subject matter I take on gets reviewed from as many sides as possible. Some of the things Iâm listing here I completely recognize as potentially being much more easier said than done. But this is my good faith effort to answer this question. Here are some take aways that Iâve learned thus far:

- Factions exist in Palestine that have a wide range of beliefs to include those who have alliances with Jews. Rashid Khalidi delves into the factional infighting between Palestinian clans, notably the Husaynis and the Nashabishis in his book âThe Iron Cage.â He doesnât give the most complete picture of all the factions and where they stand regarding Jews or things like the assassinations and intimidations carried out by the Grand Mufti Hajj Amin Hussayni. But preventing faction in-fighting to promote a more effective government is an area they could take responsibility for. The Arab revolt of 1936-39 is a great historical example of their infighting and how it compares to the Zionist state building activity. 

- Syria and Palestine have a highly complex relationship that can swing between Syria fighting with Palestine against Israel to the absolutely horrific conditions of the refugee camps. But working to create a much more stable relationship with Syria is an area they could take responsibility for by beginning to focus on a much more well-rounded foreign policy with countries that have Palestinian refugees. I delve into this further with my next bullet. 

- UNRWA has done quite a bit to harm the Palestinian cause. It allows for the inheritance of refugee status across generations. This has led to the initial 750,000 refugees becoming over 5 million today. This furthers the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by keeping it this continual open wound. Itâs believed Arab nations also take advantage of this issue of refugee inheritance by not allowing citizenship for Palestinians living in a host country. I think Jordan is the only one that allows citizenship. The UNRWA is also under fire for its highly antisemitic educational content and pro jihadist martyr materials as IMPACT-se reported on. This is a highly complicated area for Palestinians to take responsibility for as it would also require the UN to get involved. But things like working towards better assimilation into host countries by fighting for citizenship, stopping refugee inheritance, demanding a change to educational content to promote coexistence, no tolerance policy level of cracking down on employees who are part of terrorist factions, etc. 

- Demanding independent media sources to encourage reliability of information and prevent rumors that can incite violence. I have a couple reasons for this one. Currently, almost half of the death toll count, the women/children ratios, and total lack of listing how many deaths are Hamas terrorists is based on âreliable media sourcesâ in Gaza. However, they donât list which media sources in their reports and this is made further difficult as, from what I understand, Gaza has no independent media. In the Gaza Strip, there are Hamas-affiliated media such as the Shehab News agency and the Al-Aqsa Media Network. The other reason is based on rumors surrounding Israel taking over the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The riots in 1929 centered on this rumor and now Hamas is claiming one of the reasons for their attack is for similar reasons. Rumors like this have been going on for who knows how long and they donât come true, but theyâre highly effective at inciting violence. 

- Promoting economic investment into Palestinian businesses by Israelis to encourage high quality enterprises. Or just more joint business ventures between Israelis and Palestinians. This one would actually be huge because it would create a direct relationship of economic improvement with Israel and cause Israelis and Palestinians to work towards a common cause together, which helps break down damaging stereotypes, racism, mistrust, etc. held by both groups.

487,"Remind me...  Was the european terrorist colony of israel founded by peaceful violent terrorist groups like irgun/likud, lehi, and haganah?  If I look back at the history of the founding of the european terrorist colony by three european terrorist militias...  will it say ""israel was peacefully founded by three violent european terrorist militias""?

The Deir Yassin Massacre in early april 1948, was that ""peaceful""...

And...  as it happens...  Those were empty words.  There was peace then, yet, as has been the case since 1948, the violent foreign zionists have violently denied native Palestinians the basic human right of self determination.

It seems like yair lapid, who was prime minister for 6 months, supported a demilitarized Palestinian non-state on probably some bits of desert, but, evidently even that was too much...

In retrospect...  a careful observer may, if they're smart enough...  be able to realize that maybe that time, a time of peace, a time when there was peace in the Palestinian West Bank...

You know...  other than the violent israeli state supported zionist terrorism and the israeli violent land theft and violent housing demolitions...

other than that violence...  that, for some reason, yair lapid was less concerned about...  Other than that, it was a time of peace, both in the Palestinian West Bank, and in Gaza...

Yet...  contrary to his claims...  there was no recognition of the basic human right of native Palestinian self-determination...  There were no negotiations, there was no peace deal.

If you're smart enough...  you may just be smart enough to recognize that, in retrospect...  that was a mistake...

If you're smart enough...  you could look back at that time...  and look at today...  and you could think...  maybe we made the wrong choice...  Maybe we should have recognized a Palestinian state...

&gt;Where do you see a speech like this from Abbas for instance?

Abbas has continually as I understand it, advocated for peace as the militant foreign zionists agreed on in the Oslo accords...  and then broke...  as well as more generally, peace along those lines.

&gt;why is it that Palestinians get to demand all of the land when they lived only on parts of it while native Americans don't? it just doesn't add up... 

I said the native Americans should be entitled to all the land they lived on.

&gt;About Russia and Ukraine, my opinion is consistent

No it isn't.

&gt;but if Russia would control Crimea for like 4 generations, I wouldn't support the Ukrainians attacking Russia to get this land back..

You support Russian theft of Ukrainian land?

Also...  you do understand that 1948 was in...  1948?

Would you happen to know...  how long ago 1948 was?  Was it 400 years?

There are people still alive from 1948...  There are people still alive from 1912...

Violent foreign zionists today are living in stolen homes on stolen native Palestinian land of living breathing native Palestinians...

But what does their life or death change?

Every now and then I'll read about things like holocaust related court battles over things like the art collections of Jewish people that were lost in the 1940s...

Are you saying those lawsuits are wrongful?

That the holocaust survivors, and their descendants are wrong to try to reclaim their stolen property?

What do you think your belief that Russian theft of Ukrainian land would do for Russia?

If the international community recognizes Russian land theft in Ukraine...  Rewarding Russia for invading Ukraine...  Giving Russia what Russia wanted when Russia invaded Ukraine...

What message does that send Russia?

Will Russia invade more countries with your blessing?

When does the murder end...  When does the theft of land end...

Would...  perhaps...  your opinion change if it was to your personal disadvantage?  To the disadvantage of your people?

What, perchance... do you believe about the justness of the Roman occupation of Roman Palestine and the Roman expulsion of the Jews...

It seems...  according to you...  That the Romans were right to conquer Palestine, and the Romans were right to steal the privately owned land of the israelites...  to mercilessly slaughter thousands of israelites...  according to you... and to expel the israelites from Roman Palestine...

Right?

You're a big fan of Roman Palestine and what the Roman empire did to the israelites, right?

You wave a big ""Go Roman empire!"" banner, right?

&gt;Israel got the 48 partition plan through buying land and through diplomacy..

They bought almost none of the land...  and diplomacy with whom...

Was it diplomacy with the native Palestinians perhaps?

Did the violent european zionist terrorists waging a 10+ year violent terrorist campaign slaughtering thousands of innocent people... in your mind...  diplomacy the native Palestinians so well that the native Palestinians agreed to give the violent foreign terrorists their whole country and all their land?

&gt;I don't think the Zionists stole the land.

The land they took through violence that they didn't pay for?  The land they violently ethnically cleansed?

And now...  Based on your ideas...

The logical thing for the native Palestinians to do...

To take back their homeland, to take back their privately owned land that they owned....  then something happened...  and now violent foreign zionist terrorists live on it...  ones that didn't purchase the land...  and instead violently ethnically cleansed 700k+ native Palestinians and stole their land...

What should native Palestinians do to take back what you claim is fair and legitimate ownership of it...

The way the violent foreign zionist terrorists did by invading Palestine, conquering it.  And violently ethnically cleansing 700+ native Palestinians and stealing their land...

King Hussein bin Talal always kept the displaced Palestinians in concentration camps, as did all the other Arab countries of the time. Instead of absorbing them into Jordanian society, they were kept in inhuman conditions in concentration camps to pressure Israel and the United Nations. Nobody wanted the ""problem"" of Palestine to be solved. Oh, of course there were also Jewish refugees from Arab countries! Hundreds of thousands of Jews had to flee Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Algeria, Tunisia, Yemen and Morocco with nothing, leaving behind all their belongings and properties...

Israel does not have the luxury of a professional army because it is only a country of 10mm people fighting against forces many times its size.  
2. **Hamas intentionally created this situation** by a) releasing hostages into a war zone and b) by Hamas intentionally dressing as civilians when fighting in order to confuse the IDF. It's not a matter of being scared. This has nothing to do with being scared. 

You're right that we should be outraged by this tragedy. But direct your outrage in the appropriate direction: towards the Hamas terrorists who endanger civilians by: 

1. dressing up as civilians
2. embedding Hamas military infrastructure with civilians e.g. hospitals, mosques, schools etc.

âIn another exchange that took place as Israel set a deadline in February to enter Rafah before the Muslim month of Ramadan, the WSJ reported that Sinwar urged Hamasâ political leaders not to make concessions and instead push for a permanent end to the war, adding that high civilian casualties would ramp up global pressure on Israel to halt the conflict.â",12/8/2023 22:36,Pro-Israel

But air drops are a really dangerous method of delivering aid in Gaza, people [have already died](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/08/middleeast/gaza-airdropped-aid-deaths-intl/index.html) after being hit by airdrops. With airdrops, there's ofc no co-ordination and distribution of aid; if you're gonna just drop food into a sea of desperate people, there's a high risk of people being trampled to death, violence breaking out, black market gangs or Hamas instead getting it etc. Also it's logistically just impossible (and ridiculously expensive) deliver food for two million people by plane air drops for extended time. 

Gaza doesn't have infrastructure to receive planes or ships, like harbours and airports. Israel has had complete air and sea blockade on Gaza since 2006 (in the 2010's, humanitarian aid workers tried to deliver food to Gaza and Israeli forces attacked them, if you wanna read about the Freedom Flotilla operation). Now Israel has given permission to the EU and US operations to try to deliver aid by sea to Gaza, and that's why US has been building a harbour for some time now in Gaza - but it takes quite a while to make that happen, and a bit unclear how they're gonna manage the distribution safely.  

Honestly, opening the land crossings and let organisations deliver aid as unrestrictedly as possible would be by far the fastest and most effective way of bringing aid to Gaza. Especially now when Gaza is already on the brink of famine, the only way to deal with all the dire side effects of the long aid blockades like violent criminal gangs, would be to just completely 'flood' the Strip with lots of food as quickly as possible.  

Egypt has been facilitating the aid effort quite a lot, i.e. it's been letting all the aid operations use Egyptian soil, there's been packs and packs of aid trucks waiting to gain entry to Gaza throughout the war. Egypt can't just let aid in on its own initiative though, because Israel doesn't give safety guarantees to anything that it hasn't inspected, i.e. Israel would deem it ok to bomb any aid trucks let into Gaza on the assumption they'd contain military supplies to Hamas. Also as of few days ago, IDF has taken complete control over the Rafah land crossing with Egypt anyway.

The only Arab nation that shares a border with Gaza is Egypt, most of the few refugees that have left Gaza have went through Egypt. Egypt doesn't want to take in Palestinian refugees because 1) just taking in 2 million desperate and starving war refugees in one large wave is an absolutely massive internal security risk and financial burden to any country, 2) Egypt has its own problems with radical islamist groups in the Sinai desert (the region on the Egypt-Gaza border) which potential Hamas members might exacerbate, 3) driving Gazans out of Gaza would amount to an ethnic cleansing and would mean Israel has for the second time succeeded in driving a huge mass of Palestinians out of Palestine - Egypt doesn't trust Israel to let the refugees ever return to Gaza, 4) if Israel were to succeed in 3), this would be a very inflammatory issue for MENA politics, and most likely Egypt is also worried it would damage its reputation and relationships with other Arab states (which are by no means always simplistic and cordial), if Egypt is seeing as aiding Israel in this.",12/8/2023 7:24,Neutral

Israel won a lot of sympathy after the Holocaust, and even though I don't buy it, a lot of people believe that Israel was created because of the Holocaust (I think it would have happened anyway, but we'll never know). And Israel was the underdog until the 1970s. If you can find the Life cover story after the Six-Day War, you'd see what I mean. But being victims of the worst genocide in history doesn't give you carte blanche forever. Israel's street cred started going way down with the Lebanon War in 1982, when it invaded the country, seiged Beirut and killed thousands of civilians. Ever since, Israel has been the Goliath and the Palestinians the David.

There is no chance they would allow Rafah to be open to contraband or terrorist troops, which means Egypt cannot violate that without an international incident.

No, what Israel hopes to achieve is neutralization of the threat from Hamas. It let Palestinians knos well ahead of time about the invasion of Rafah, so they could evacuate - nothing stops hamas members from tagging along, they don't walk around wearing uniforms. What it does achieve however is catching the actual threat - logistics such as bases, tunnels that they use to hid in and most important weaponry.  Mainstream media barely reports it, but Hamas and PIJ continuosly throught the war shot and still do rockets and mortars into Israel, just a few days ago they struck the very border crossing used by humanitarian aid trucks (which kinda made the headlines) but this happens all the time, this one only got on the news because people died.

This can only be stage 1 though, sure, neutralize the threat, punish those reponsible for October 7th and what not, but if Israeli government REALLY don't want the cycle to just begin anew right after and place in the same spot 50 years down the line it needs to take some hard to swallow pills and take reaponsibility for Gaza, and start to rebuild it and deprogram the people similar to the Marshal Plan in Germany post WW2.

533,"Now that we're in a place where Hamas is crippled, we can talk about ""the day after."" Let's zoom out from Rafah and travel back in time by seven years. Let's go to Raqqa in the year 2017. Daesh is crippled after simultaneous operations by the SDF, the Iraqi Kurds, and their NATO allies. Daesh is forced out of Mosul which is now a city destroyed, with roughly 10 Iraqi civilians killed for every one Daesh fighter in the nine month campaign, which saw Daesh use thousands of Iraqi civilians as hostages and human shields. As of 2024, we are still counting the deaths from the battle of Mosul. Meanwhile, Daesh is holed up in the Raqqa national hospital with a few thousand fighters, stockpiles of explosives and ammunition, and thousands of Syrian hostages (more than 90% of civilians in Raqqa are displaced by this conflict). The SDF and the Americans negotiate a ceasefire / peace deal where Daesh fighters will be trucked out of Raqqa be night with their families and their weapons. This prevents a final bloody siege in Raqqa national hospital, and frees the remaining Syrian hostages. Many Daesh fighters are not themselves Syrian, and they traveled from across the world to join the cause of Daesh. Now they flee Syria, and disappear into the desert. I've spoken to intelligence chiefs who have confirmed that most of these Daesh fighters crossed the border into Turkey and then the EU, and that these former Daesh fighters from Raqqa are responsible for many of the terror attacks in Europe since 2017. [Daesh's flight to victory](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/raqqas_dirty_secret) is, to me, one of the single greatest mistakes of the global war on terrorism.

I think the parable of Raqqa is an important one. Israel could theoretically negotiate a ceasefire where every hostage is released, and where Sinwar and his remaining forces completely withdraw from Gaza. These terrorists might say they crave martyrdom, but given the choice between surrender and death, we will see what choice they take. However, the first problem is, where would Hamas go if they are forced out of Gaza? Not to the Sinai. The Egyptian and Israeli air forces actually conduct joint missions against Daesh in the Sinai. The Egyptians would invade Gaza themselves if it kept Hamas out of the Sinai. President Sisi came to power amid a coup d'etat which ousted the Muslim Brotherhood, and he continues to suppress them. I'd say Sisi hates Hamas even more than Netanyahu, so Hamas can't go south from Rafah. The Emir of Qatar seems furious with Haniyeh, so I doubt Sinwar will be welcome in Doha. In the early days, Qatar seemed to want to use this war to project soft power. They hosted the World Cup, Al Jazeera is a global brand, they own real estate in London and New York... Qatar was emerging as a small country with an outsized cultural influence, like Japan or Italy. However, Qatar's role as mediator backfired since Haniyeh negotiated in bad faith (or possibly that Haniyeh overstated his influence over Yahyah Sinwar and the late Mohammad Deif). So, Qatar is furious behind the scenes, and they see their relationship with Hamas as more of a liability. I think it's possible that Qatar might even negotiate to extradite Haniyeh to the Hague to stand trial for crimes against humanity.

I think the only countries left who have any positive opinions of Hamas are Ireland, South Africa, Turkey, and Iran. Hamas is not going to Iran-- Khamenei is not interested in letting his chickens come home to roost. Hamas are Arab and Sunni nationalists, they would go on a murderous rampage if they wound up in a Shia and Persian country. Daesh, like Hamas, is not just an enemy of Israel and the west. Daesh and Hamas are enemies of all people, worldwide. So, that leaves Turkey-- as much as Ireland and South Africa like to make fools of themselves on the global stage, they don't actually want to import a few thousand trained and armed terrorists. And, if let loose in Turkey, Hamas could go south to Syria to join what remains of Daesh, Or they could go east to Russia and Turkestan to join Daesh's forces in Iran and Afghanistan and Russia (and, judging by the attacks in Tehran and Moscow, Daesh is a lot stronger in the east than in the west). Or, like the Daesh fighters from Raqqa, they could go west into Europe and wreck havoc on France and Germany. Perhaps Israel will be satisfied to get Hamas out of Gaza via a negotiated hostage release and withdrawal. But where will Hamas go? If they're not Israel's problem, then whose problem will they become? France's problem? Russia's problem? I don't know.

I'm talking about the failures in Raqqa because we all know the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, how America failed to build a functioning state after removing the Taliban from Afghanistan, and how ousting Saddam led Daesh to fill the power vacuum. But what's discussed less is that we actually ended the campaign against Daesh in Iraq and Syria via a negotiated surrender of Daesh's remaining forces in their fortress at Raqqa National Hospital. And, that brought peace to Raqqa but it didn't lead to the end of Daesh or their terror. I'm going to end on a quote by Kissinger on Vietnam. ""The guerilla wins when he doesn't lose. The conventional army loses when it doesn't win."" Anything less than the complete annihilation of Hamas and Daesh is going to be a victory for the terrorists.",12/5/2023 21:29,Neutral

547,"&gt;right. and how exactly would you define fascist? 

Here's a definition that sounds pretty spot on to me:

Fascism (/ËfÃ¦ÊÉªzÉm/ FASH-iz-Ém) is a far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement, characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation and/or race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy.

Now let's examine:

**Far right ideology?** Check. Israel's government is definitely on the right. Even the so called moderates are still right wing, just not far right.

**Authoritarian?** Check. You can't say this isn't true. Netanyahu has been in power now for how long? 1996-1999, then 2009-2021, then 2022 to present. This is troubling from the American perspective, as this is a long period of time to cement his influence. Dictators don't just start out as a dictator. They're usually put in power through elections or some other way (revolution), then gradually cement their power and influence until they are able to rule unchallenged. Vladimir Putin is a dictator. Russia has elections. So just because there are elections doesn't automatically discredit this point.

Authoritarian governments are also characterized by their wanting to control the media, to be able to filter or eliminate things and control what information gets to the public. Israel literally JUST did this, by banning Al Jazeera. I know you'll make an excuse for it. You guys can have excuses for everything.

They're also characterized by the strong crackdown on dissent and protests. Arab Israeli ""citizens"" are unable to even protest in Israel right now. Arab Israeli ""citizens"" since the start of the war have been arrested for Facebook posts. Any expression of solidarity with the Palestinian ppl is cracked down on by he Israeli government.

Lots of snitches too. I just watched an interview from an Arab Israeli woman who described the climate there. She said that she made a Facebook post just expressing her sadness about the suffering of Gazans, and people she worked with and thought were her friends called the Israeli police when they saw it. ð You could not get a more dystopian, ""turn in your neighbors for even saying something that the government MIGHT not approve of,"" secret police, Ann Frank type of environment if you tried. It's like Israel, I swear, they directly copied the policies of another effective fascist movement.

**Ultranationalist Political Ideology? Check.**

Israel the state was founded on the belief that although there were already others living in the area they wanted for their Jewish state, the need of the Jews to have their own state WHERE THEY WANTED IT was more important than the locals living there. Villages were massacred, 750,000 displaced and ethnically cleansed, and numerous other atrocities. Israel was founded on terrorism. These are historical facts. Regardless of what's being taught to Israelis in school. Israel REclassified it's founding documents back in the 1980's and won't even allow Israeli professors to access them. Why? Because they are brainwashing their own citizens by pushing a false, whitewashed narrative.

**Authoritarian Leader? Check.**

(Already covered)

**Militarism? Check.**

This is self explanatory and doesn't even need to be argued as far as mandatory service. Israel is also not done expanding. Israel refuses to declare it's borders, because they're subject to change and not set yet.

**Forcible Suppression of Opposition? Check.**

I already explained the Arab Israeli ""citizens"" are cracked down upon for Facebook posts or showing any mercy whatsoever towards the ppl of Gaza. Israel can and does arrest Arab Israelis on ""terrorism charges"" for these things, because this is the opposition. The opposition is not the disagreements within the Jews of Israel. No, that's small potatoes. The opposition is the Arab minority. Most Jewish Israelis (almost all) approve of the war. That's not the opposition. That's thinking we should be doing what we all agree on doing (the war) in a different way (hostage deal vs Rafah given priority, etc). But the war itself is not in question for Jews in Israel.

**Belief in Natural Social Hierarchy? Check.**

Jews are first class citizens. Arab Israelis are a marginalized minority. You can say they ""have all the same rights"" but it's still BS. Everyone knows it. They say it in documentary and interview after interview how they are discriminated against. The Jews are a supremacist nation in Israel. It's NUMBER 1 FUNCTION is to protect and serve JEWS, it's even official law. It's an ethnostate. 

 I can go on and on. It's like that fascist definition was written for Israel. Either Israel or (old) Germany. I can't tell the difference. Now you know: Israel is a fascist, racist, supremacist state, that oppresses others. They are evil. The WHOLE WORLD except for maybe a handful of countries (bought and paid for by AIPAC, the others trickle down from that) is condemning Israel. You have the chance now to dissociate yourself and condemn them too. But as an Israeli, I understand this takes a high level and large amount of moral courage to accept the harsh truth, and to do what's right even though most others will not. Most ppl don't have this moral courage. That's how you get 98% of Israelis to agree, or how Germany most of society was in lock step with each other, because most ppl will do the wrong thing when faced with this choice. You are LIKELY part of this ""most."" Ppl like you will be condemned in the future (even by the ones supporting you now).",12/3/2023 22:37,Pro-Palestine

&gt;TEL AVIV â An NBC News investigation into seven deadly airstrikes has found Palestinians were killed in areas of southern Gaza that the Israeli military had explicitly designated as safe zones.

&gt;The attacks took place from January to April, as Israelâs military bombarded Rafah from the air and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâs government signaled its intent to launch a full-scale ground invasion on Gazaâs southernmost city, which has now swelled to more than 1 million people.  



&gt;NBC News camera crews filmed the bloody aftermath of the six strikes on Rafah itself and one strike farther north on the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, which was also designated safe by Israel.

&gt;The crews compiled the GPS coordinates of each strike, all of which hit an area identified by the Israeli military as an evacuation zone in an online interactive map it published on Dec. 1. The map has not been updated since then and the Israel Defense Forces told NBC News in a statement Sunday that it remained accurate.


&gt;Sari Bashi, Human Rights Watchâs program director, said in an interview that the incidents highlighted in NBC Newsâ investigation are not isolated.

&gt;âPeople are fleeing to roads that the government told them to use to places where the Israeli government told them to go,â said Bashi, who has tracked the humanitarian impact of Israelâs military offensive in Gaza. âAnd when they go there, they get killed.â",12/1/2023 5:13,Pro-Palestine

I can assure you, so am I.

Up until this moment I was not aware of the Srebrenica genocide, and I just read the Wikipedia article about it to understand the horrifying and disgusting details of summary executions and mass rapes.

The key difference between the Srebrenica genocide and the warfare that is occuring in Gaza is the brutal, deliberate, and specific manner in which the Serbian soldiers committed their horrifying facts. Establishing clear intent from war superiors/decision-makers and individual soldiers is also not a problem in the case of the Srebrenica genocide.

None of what I just described in the paragraph above can be said in the Gaza war. There are no specific or deliberate attempts to brutally murder innocent Gazans, Hamas takes great care to maximise human shields, and in doing so to maximise civilian casualties. The IDF is justified, and even required to eliminate Hamas terrorists to defend themselves, and tragically innocent human shields are caught in the crossfire as civilian casualties.

Furthermore, there is no established intent from the Israeli side to commit genocide. Stupid, extremist comments from extremist politicians in the government don't count as they have no power to decide anything in the governing of the Gaza war, and for good reason as I'm sure you'll agree. Israel is a democracy, unfortunately stupid politicians are free to say whatever they want.

In fact, nearly all public Israeli war officials and decision-makers said they are doing everything they can to avoid civilian casualties and move civilians out of harm's way, not the opposite.

574,"&gt;You stole their land.

Before 1948 the land belonged to the UK.

Both the Jewish and the Arabs wanted a state so the UN decided to make a partition plan the split the land to 2 states during 1947.

The Jewish people agreed to it but the Arabs refused, so in the 14th of May 1948 - the day the British mandate was over, Israel declared its own state like it was planned but the Arabs who refused to share attacked Israel with the help of many other Arab states in the area like Egypt &amp; Jordan in order to kill all Jewish people and claim the land for yet another Arab state.

For their surprise the Jewish people won the war and since it was an all-or-noting war, they got to keep the land.

What about this story is stolen exactly..?

&gt;you still do not take responsibility of the people youâve conquered.

Israel literally gave citizenship to all Arabs in their borders...

Later after they won Gaza from Egypt (Egypt refused to take it back btw), they released it in 2005 (Only for the people of Gaza to elect a terror group that forced Israel &amp; Egypt to put a blockade on the area)

And won Judea &amp; Samaria/the west bank from Jordan  - Jordan also does not want the area back, and in 1993-1995 accords were signed between the Israeli &amp; the Palestinian government in order to split the territory.

What part of it is not taking a responsibility?

&gt;Youâre not justified in bombing hospitals, refugee camps, and forcing refugees to stay in Gaza.

First of all, Israel didn't force anyone to stay in Gaza, the contrary - they asked the people to go through the Rafah crossing but Egypt closed it, and nowadays think about a new plan for letting the Arabs to move to a different country until the war is over. So in the meanwhile the people of Gaza should be in the south as Israel doesn't bomb there and asked the people to evacuate to the south in order not to innocents. Israel also allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza because like you said - their war is not with all of Gaza, it's with Hamas. 

As for not allowed to bomb all of the areas you described, Hamas hides under those areas with a complex set of tunnels, unless you have a better way to get rid of Hamas and its tunnels - Israel kind of has to shoot those areas in order to kill terrorists that hide in there.",11/27/2023 4:22,Pro-Israel

579,"I haven't really followed MatÃ©, the only extended interviews I've seen any significant portion of were the Piers Morgan one referenced in this video, and one with Cornell West, but Finkelstein who engages in a lot of outspoken bluster is all over my YouTube suggestions so I've seen quite a bit of his take. I hadn't really linked them together in their perspective, but I think I understand what you're saying about using emotional appeals. However, this does not seem a tactic isolated to either side, and I'm not sure I see any lies or misinformation presented, at least in the video you provide.

Mostly, these seem like common counter-factuals which actually echo the same tactics. In response to MatÃ© calling the 1948 war controversial,  the commentator simply says it was not controversial because there was a UN proposal for partition which the Israelis accepted and the Palestinians did not. Which I would say is plainly not accurate. There was a UN proposal for partitioning two states, but it was subject to 6 months of UN negotiations between the two groups, which the Israeli side circumvented by outright declaring independence. I would say that seems controversial.

Then, in response to what seems to be a fact stated by MatÃ©, that Israel has occupied Gaza and West Bank since 1967, the commentor responds that Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, and it did not solve the problem of violence. Yet, this is also an extremely controversial topic, and moreover he completely ignores the 95% of Palestine which West Bank represents. Yes, Israel withdrew from Gaza which is the size of a small city. But, this simply placed Gaza in the same state as every city in West Bank, under full Israeli blockade. None of the core issues of occupation were addressed. It just relegated Gaza to the status of ""Area A"", as all cities in the rest of Palestine, surrounded by Israeli military control.

The commentator then responds to MatÃ©'s corollary between the plight of native peoples in the Americas and the plight of the Palestinians by saying that 100 years ago, there were no Palestinians, which I think is plainly disingenuous. It's one thing to say the term Palestinian is somewhat recent, which is also controversial, but the peoples had been there for millennia, contemporary with all Jewish history in the region. They are equally indigenous to the land. It's not as if Native Americans called themselves Native Americans either, they each had their own histories and names. The peoples and their history are what's important, not which term is used to refer to them as a group today.

The commentator then goes on to claim that Israel does not control Gaza with a blockade, because Gaza also shares a border with Egypt, the small crossing of Rafah, which is in fact controlled by both Israel and Egypt together in an international security agreement, in lockstep with the Israeli guidelines for its own blockade of the other 99% of access to Gaza, all airspace, coastline and land crossings. Israel leverages complete control over Gaza, yes in very small part this is in coordination with Egypt, but how does that change the overwhelming control Israel exerts over what international law considers occupied territory?

Then he compares Israel and Palestine to the Allied and Axis forces during WW2, imploring how strange it would have been to expect the US to supply Germany with food during a war, when the issue is rather again an ongoing occupation. When the US occupied Germany and Japan, it was indeed their responsibility to supply food, water and medical aid to those peoples. And it was their mercy in doing so which aided in those occupations lasting just 7yrs, rebuilding bitter, racist, xenophobic cultures into fledgling democracies with thriving modernized economies who against all odds transformed into strong allies with the US and Europe, to this day. The Israeli occupation has last now fully 8x as long, an unbearable condition for any peoples.

He also asserts many other controversial facts of his own, without any other commentary, such as the Jewish people's connection to that land is ""greater"" than anyone else's, describes the cobbled borders of the UN partition plan as ""logical"", and conveniently forgets the 95% of Palestine which is West Bank, and the occupation in general, throughout.  If anything, I think this demonstrates the gap which must be bridged in these conversations between parties such as MatÃ© and the views outlined in this video in response.

&gt;In addition to numerous eyewitness accounts, including from independent journalists who saw the aftermath of the massacre and photographic evidence, there is enough proof to say that babies were indeed beheaded during the Hamas rampage.

The original [snopes](https://www.snopes.com/news/2023/10/12/40-israeli-babies-beheaded-by-hamas/) article that lied had to issue an article on December 4th ... which nobody read:

&gt;On Oct. 20, 2023, forensic experts told [reporters](https://themedialine.org/top-stories/evidence-on-display-at-israels-forensic-pathology-center-confirms-hamas-atrocities/) they had seen evidence of beheaded babies but could not confirm if knives or rocket-propelled grenades (RPG) caused the decapitations. \[...\]  
**The Media Line.** On Oct. 20, 2023, the American outlet that focuses on Middle East coverage [detailed](https://themedialine.org/top-stories/evidence-on-display-at-israels-forensic-pathology-center-confirms-hamas-atrocities/) a visit to **Israel's National Center of Forensic Medicine to review evidence of the atrocities. Photographs revealed by the forensics team showed charred flesh of victims.** [**Dr. Chen Kugel**](https://themedialine.org/top-stories/evidence-on-display-at-israels-forensic-pathology-center-confirms-hamas-atrocities/)**, the head of the center, said the victims ranged from 3 months to 80 or 90 years old. He said many bodies, including those of babies, were without heads. When asked if they were decapitated, he said yes. But, under the circumstances, he said, it was difficult to ascertain whether they were decapitated before or after death, as well as how they were beheaded, ""whether cut off by knife or blown off by RPG \[Rocket Propelled Grenade\].""** Additionally, an Oct. 24, 2023, report by The Media Line detailed how [journalists](https://themedialine.org/top-stories/horrific-footage-of-hamas-atrocities-revealed-by-idf-shakes-global-media/) were invited by the Israeli military to screen videos consisting of home surveillance footage, Hamas' GoPro bodycams, dashcams, cellphone footage, and more. At the screening, Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said, ""Saying \[Hamas\] is ISIS is not some branding trick. Hamas is a sovereign entity that decided to commit this crime against humanity â¦ to rape, to kill indiscriminately, to behead people.\[...\]

On Dec. 4, 2023, [Haaretz](https://archive.li/H6rAm) published a **report it claimed detailed the circumstances of ""most"" child deaths at the hands of Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023. None of those child deaths explicitly mentioned beheadings, though the report said of all killings: ""Hamas terrorists did desecrate corpses during the massacre, especially the bodies of soldiers. There were also beheadings and cases of dismemberment.""** As far as infants, Haaretz and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/14-kids-under-10-25-people-over-80-up-to-date-breakdown-of-oct-7-victims-we-know-about/) reported one infant from Be'eri, a kibbutz in southern Israel, was among the minors killed. Also, a pregnant Bedouin woman who was about to give birth was reportedly shot and killed. Doctors delivered the baby, but it did not survive.

Now this, I disagree with:

Israel is not looking for any excuse to invade anyone if it was the case they would have participated in the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Targeting government officials is an act of war and the 1982 war was justified. If Israel wanted to invade so bad why did they leave?

600,"&gt;What gives the people who have arrived from Europe to decide how the land is split?

I assume that by the people from Europe you mean the UK as they pretty much the only European country that tried to offer its own version for a split.

The territory belonged to the UK and the majority of the world if not all of it approved it. 

They didn't force any split btw, and it's fair for the Arabs to reject it - but if the Arabs refuse to split the land, and refuse to acknowledge Israel - then it's only fair to allow Israel to refuse acknowledging the Palestinians.

Especially since the Palestinians would use that freedom to attack Israel as was proven with Gaza.

&gt; Furthermore, may I ask why these were rejected?  
The Oslo Accords failed as a result of Netanyahu breaking them and he literally admits to this. Watch his leaked video in 2001 too.

Depends on the time and the deal.

The original deals were rejected because the Palestinians rejected a Jewish state and only accepted  an Arab state from the river to the sea. Or as the old saying in Arabic goes ""Water to water, Palestine will be Arab""  (I assume you or at least others who read this comment are probably familiar with the wrong English version of ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"").

Those are the deals before 1948. Between 1948 to 1967 the Palestinians were under Egyptian, Lebanese &amp; Jordanian control so no deal could have been held...

For the Oslo accords, I'm well aware of what Netanyahu said but he can say whatever he wants to impress his right-wing voters (It's not new for Netanyahu to lie) when in reality that was not the case, the deal was pretty simple - Israel gives the Palestinians territories from area C in 3 steps while the Palestinians show proof for fighting terrorism and stopping their support of terrorism (funding of terrorist, education system that calls for attacks on Jews, etc...). When the time for the first step arrived, Israel followed their part and delivered the territories they needed. The Palestinians on the other hand showed no progress in fighting terrorism so the deal was off. Up until this day the Palestinian authority still pays terrorists and their families for their actions (needless to say - that includes the 7th of October terrorists) and their education system calls for ""The greater Palestine"" or in different word conquering Israel, presenting Jews as the devil and calling for any form of violence against them no matter what it takes. So again, Netanyahu can claim he's the one who stopped the deals like he claimed he was strong against Hamas and refused getting out of Gaza in 2005 - in reality the man can't stop lying about everything and even history book proves it...

For the camp David summit, the Palestinians just rejected everything, provided no counter offer and then launched a massive terror wave known as Intifada. No real explanation for why the rejected everything was presented and the US blamed the Palestinians for the deal failing.

2006-2008 Olmert-Abbas conversations took 2 years and ended with no real solution before Israel needed to go to elections again. I'm not blaming any side for the conversations failing as no side blames the other, but I still think that 2 years of conversations are too much... I know peace deals shouldn't take a day or even a week but 2 years? Way too much... Especially when you take into account Israel offered the Palestinians majority (More than 90%) of the 1967 borders only asking for peace, and the Palestinians don't need to give Israel anything, just accept its existence and not attack it.  

2009 Netanyahu's offer was just responded with anger by the Arab world despite the fact he offered the Palestinians a state. 

2016 - This was Trump's plan, and it was rejected by the Palestinians just because it was Trump who offered it. 

I know I didn't mention smaller talks like the one on 2010 or 2013 but that was mostly because this comment is already getting pretty long and the general idea repeats - the Palestinians don't offer anything themselves, they wait for others to offer something and then reject it despite the fact they are the side that needs something from Israel and not the other way around.",11/22/2023 12:57,Pro-Israel

B)thereâs a common misconception that Israel is providing most of the aid. This is incorrect. UAE provides the most with  more than 27% of aid going into Gaza. Turkey is second with 19%. (This is if we are only considering countries, not aid groups) 

Israel hasnât actually done much other than letting aid into Gaza (which is something they have to do via international law). And the aid they are letting in is not adequate enough to support the entire population of Gaza. It wasnât enough, even before the conflict.

You have to remember that almost everything Israel does is a PR thing. Israel wants to appease everyone, while still maintaining their own personal motives. Which is why they did not accept the most recent ceasefire deal, despite the fact that it would have brought a significant increase to bringing the rest of the hostages in. Israel knew that once they signed it, they couldnât continue the invasion into Rafah like they want.

It's important to address some misconceptions here. The phrase ""From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Free"" is commonly associated with the goal of eliminating Israel entirely, not just advocating for Palestinian rights. It suggests the expulsion or subjugation of Jewish inhabitants. Similarly, ""Globalize the Intifada"" implies spreading violent uprisings beyond the Palestinian territories. And ""we donât want a Jewish state, we want 48"" references the year 1948 when Israel was established, indicating a desire to undo Israel's existence, which would indeed threaten the safety and rights of Jewish citizens. It unfortunately doesnât seem to suggest any form of a two state solution. By the way the chant from the river to the sea in Arabic is âfrom the river to the sea palestine will be Arabiaââ¦ it means no Jews in the region. It might be an important point to consider.  

While there were periods of relative historical coexistence between Jews and Muslims in the region, it's crucial to recognize that this coexistence was often marred by violence and discrimination. Prior to the establishment of Israel, there were instances of targeted violence and massacres against Jewish communities. For example, the Hebron massacre in 1929 saw dozens of Jewish residents killed by Arab rioters, highlighting the volatility of the situation. Additionally, in 1851, a Jew from Petah Tikva was murdered, reflecting ongoing tensions.

Moreover, historical records indicate that Jews were subjected to various forms of oppression under Muslim rule. For centuries, Jews in the region faced discriminatory laws, economic marginalization, and sporadic outbreaks of violence. Instances of Jewish slavery under Muslim rule have been documented, further illustrating the challenges faced by Jewish communities.

Additionally, the Nakba occurred after the Arabs declined the two-state solution and initiated a war, in an attempt to genocide the Jews and to âthrow them to the seaâ, and lost, resulting in the loss of land. It's worth considering why Jews don't have the right to return to Arab countries, yet Arabs expect to have the right of return to Israel. Addressing these discrepancies is essential for understanding the complexities of the situation and working towards a fair and lasting resolution.",11/20/2023 6:46,Pro-Israel

The One Democratic State Initiative is one of the organizations helping coordinate this action which aims at allowing for the entrance of vital humanitarian aid as well as of health workers, journalists and renowned individuals whose presence in Gaza might deter the genocide. This action will also a huge boost to the morale of the Gazans who are facing the enemies' brutality on their own.

The success of this convoy is crucial to the sumud of Palestinians in Gaza, a milestone in the struggle to decolonize Palestine. So far, **thousands have committed to join, and the number is increasing by the hour!** Here is how you can take part in this:

1. Can you and people you know come to Egypt to take part in this convoy and head to Rafah? Ideal would be to be there from the 23rd to the 28th, but it's the 24th that's most crucial. If you can, please [sign up](https://globalconscienceconvoy.org/form) (scroll down to the bottom of the letter) + notify the Egyptian embassy in your country + send [us](mailto:globalconscienceconvoy@odsi.co) or [the Convoy](mailto:globalconscienceconvoy@proton.me) a picture of your passport if you're not Egyptian so we can help you get the permits you need to reach Rafah.
2. The more ""noise"" we make about this, the more people it will rally, and the harder it will be for those happy with the genocide to stop us. Please talk about it EVERYWHERE, orally and via social media: Write about it, make personal videos about it, share this post about itâmake as much noise as you can.
3. Are you in touch with renowned individuals (officials, politicians, writers, reporters, doctors, syndicalists, celebrities, etc.) that could join the convoy, or perhaps even enter Gaza? If so, please share this with them so they can either contact us or contact the Convoy.

We're sure you have tons of questions such as suggestions about accommodation or personal safety. You'll probably find the answers to them on [the Convoy's website](https://globalconscienceconvoy.org). Otherwise, please [email the Convoy](mailto:globalconscienceconvoy@proton.me) or [us](mailto:globalconscienceconvoy@odsi.co) about any other questions you might have.

There was a video I saw posted of a Hamas terrorist going into peoples homes and killing them point blank and laughing. Then was found by an IDF soldier and was shot with the bastard then groveling and pleading for mercy when approached but the IDF soldier had none to spare and the terrorist was then gunned down mercilessly.

On October 6th, 2023, the most popular presidential candidate [amongst Palestinians polled](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-amaney-jamal.html) was a man in Israeli prison for murdering multiple civilians in bombings during the Second Intifada, including arranging others who suicide bombed markets and buses.

644,"Now I think we're getting to a good place, but sadly look at how long it has taken the two of us. I think (correct me if I'm wrong) that some of the things I say you wouldn't have assumed are thoughts I hold. Now a few thoughts:

1. I'm not putting the blame on Israel because of *any reason* except that I think that's the intellectually honest point. Israel is to blame for *most* of this and Israel is the *controlling* entity with all the power. It's on Israel. 

I find this argument as very weak, ""stop blaming us for the wrongs we've done or otherwise we'll burn down the house and go crazy."" I blame Israel because it has wrong and if it decides to play the victim card and now acknowledge and fix her wrongs, then it will simply be guilty of more crimes.

2. You mentioned something on the Arabs needing ""to take a lesson from history and \[resolve\] this by helping dismantle Likud and changing the system not by destroying Israel"" and I think this kind of thinking is exactly the problem.

Why do you think that by asking Israel to acknowledge let alone atone for its sins is ""destroying Israel""? Worse yet, you assume that my intention is to ""destroy Israel""? Why is that the immediate assumption?

Nakba denial is academically, intellectually, and morally dishonest and all the refusal to acknowledge just how wrong that was and to fix it (including realizing that the Gaza we're dealing with today is a direct result of that) is to the oppressed Palestinians *just as bad* (and I understand it's relative and I'm not doing an absolute comparison) as other forms of denials of atrocities with plenty of academic and detailed evidence of their happening.

3. I do think Egypt is responsible for having committed a lot of wrongs. But Gaza is *absolutely* not our fault nor is Hamas' rise. The Nakba is almost certainly not on us. A war between two militaries (with a lot of context/nuance) did not and can not justify the murders, rape, or pillage that certain Jewish militias did indeed do in the spring and summer of 1948 to civilians across the land.

What we are indeed responsible for and most of us shamelessly deny is our forcible expulsion of our own Jewish population in the 1950s and 1960s. Neither the 1956 Tripatriate Aggression nor the Six-Day War (both in our view an unwarranted Israeli attack fwiw) justify what we subsequently did to our Jewish population, disenfranchising them, stripping them of their citizenship, turning their lives upside down, and forcing them after a life of honor and dignity to start over as refugees in Israel or elsewhere.

I think justice and fairness only matters if it's consistently applied. So just as I am rightly blaming Israel for the sins she has committed, I am ready to admit the sins my country has. Just as I think Israel needs to atone and make up for the Nakba, so too should my country (and I would advocate all others but I am at the end of the day only Egyptian) atone for her sins. That includes acknowledgement, apologies, passports, reparations, and all that is fair.

4. ""Personally i think they should ask the saudi's to garantee the safety and fight terrorism in gaza as a prelude to a proper palestinian state.""

lol. With what army haha? In all seriousness, I appreciate what you're getting at, so how about this? I think Israelis deserve to feel safety and security and not think they're going to be annihilated. The Israeli insecurity is rooted in some legitimate fears and neighborhood dynamics; we can do a lot more to make the Israelis feel welcome rather than the cold or economic peace treaties we have now. I and most reasonable nuanced centrists in the region believe that a Palestinian state is required and Israel does not have the right to bury that prospect forever using ""security"" as an excuse to prolong a brutal occupation *especially* when the people running Israel are Kahanists or corrupt one-staters that are busy settling every hilltop in the West Bank, something you seem to be against as well. 

If Israel was to show us that it's serious about ending the occupation and giving the Palestinians justice, dignity, and self-determination I would be super supportive of the Egyptian army itself guaranteeing peace and security to Israel; whether Hamas or Iran ever seek to do something stupid, Israel would be supported by Egypt itself militarily. But there has to be a light at the end of the tunnel of an end to the besiegement of the Palestinians.

5. ""there is no justification for what israel has done in gaza, the destruction of hamas is necessary, though i do not think attacking Rafah will add anything.""

I agree with you on all of these points, akhi! Again, I'm Egyptian and Hamas is no friend of mine. I fear that the IDF is creating a Hamas 2.0 out of all the orphans it's creating and I desperately just want the war to end so both the hostages and Gazans can go back home. I don't think Rafah is going to do anything but ensure Bibi stays in power a little longer.

648,"So about the blockadeâ¦ On 2004, Israel decided to disengage from Gaza and transfer authority of the Gaza Strip to the PLO. Although Gaza would technically become Palestinian and subject to the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, it would still be restrained by several restrictions laid by Israel. In par with the disengagement plan, Israel decided to limit Gazan airspace and some of its trade capabilities with the external world to avoid any security breaches. 

Most of those restrictions intended to be temporary - Israel confirmed the possibility of reopening the Gazan airport and permitting free sea travel in and out of Gaza. However, on 2007, following the illegal Hamas takeover of Gaza Strip, Israel unformally initiated a blockade over the Gaza Strip, tightening the former restrictions that were placed against Gaza on 2005.

The blockade that followed 2007 was orientated around increasing the severity of the restrictions that applied over the passage of goods between Israel and Gaza. This was a result of the PLO's loss of authority over Gaza and its inability to supervise and surveillance goods entering and leaving Gaza. The entire process of blockading Gaza and all the restrictions restrictions over Gaza were agreed upon and supported by the PLO's chairman, Mahmoud Abbas, Occasionally, some crossings would temporarily shut down due to constant mortar and rocket fire that endangers the civilians passing through the crossing. Still, more than 10,000 truckloads of good would enter Gaza through the Israeli-Gazan crossings every month. Following 2007 and up to this day, the Israeli blockade over Gaza could be summarized in 3 points:
- Full control over Gazan airspace
- Safety control on the extents of the Gazan maritime territory
- Control over the crossings between Israel and Gaza

Nevertheless, Israel can not impose a blockade over Gaza all by itself. Gaza borders both Israel and Egypt. The Egyptian-Gazan crossing, Rafah, is not under Israeli jurisdiction, but rather under mutual control of both Hamas and Egypt. Egypt also declared its own blockade over Gaza, consequently to Israel's blockade, following systematic attacks of Islamic militants in the Sinai Peninsula and overwhelming attempts to smuggle illegal goods to Gaza. 

Nowadays, Israel still makes an effort to ease up the blockade and increase trade between Israel and Gaza. On 2010, Israel allowed Gaza to directly export goods to outside world. On 2012, Israel reduced the buffer zone on the Israeli-Gazan border from 300 meters to 100 meters. On 2014, Israel removed the prolonged prohibition on the passage of individuals and transfer of goods between the West Bank and Gaza. In 2018, Israel permitted the unrestricted passage of billions of dollars from Qatar to Gaza. On 2019 and 2022, Israel has made significant expansions Gaza' s nautical zone, expanding it to 12 and 10 miles in certain directions. Egypt, on 2022, had also made efforts to ease up the blockade on its behalf by constructing a trade center next to the Rafah crossing and promoting trade passing through the crossing.",11/16/2023 15:06,Pro-Israel

666,"ok I'll bite, I really hope youre a sincere person open to learning more and not going to dismiss it as ""hasbara"" 

* **But Hamas** \-  yeah who created / funded Hamas in the 80s?


Israel didn't ""create"" Hamas but they supported the movement bc at the time the alternative was the PLO which was a secular terrorist group (Munich, Avivim terror attacks among others) Israel believed at the time that the Islamist movement would be better than the secular movement bc they educated the youth in universities and taught religious values. Israel had a theory that an Islamist leadership group would be more peaceful. Boy were they wrong. 


* **Human Shields** 
I mean the hospital operation is not an example of a human shield. it's a black op that actually oy eliminated the intended target with no civilian casualties. Israel is famous for covert operations, they have spies allover the world and certainly in Palestine, they perform black op assassinations a whole lot. If you think that's a bad thing, well fine, that's probably be er going to change it's been an essential tool to their survival.btw the targets of this operation according to Israel were masterminding a massive Oct 7 copycat attack from the West Bank. 

None of this negates the fact that the civilian casualties in Gaza are higher than they should be bc of Hamas well documented (literally for decades not just in this war and we'll known to the US and other intelligence agencies worldwide) that Hamas encourages Gazans to martyr themselves, to gather or not to evacuate places Israel has declared will be attacked , they fight in heavily populated civilian zones and operate from civilian centers. 


* **Command Center Bunker and tunnels under a Hospita**

Israel did not build the tunnels under Shifa they built the basement bunker as an extension of the hospital and an emergency wartime operation ward when Israel still occupied Gaza. Hamas then used these bunkers and connected them to the Gaza metro tunnel system. 

* **Killed civilians on Oct 7** \-
Haaretz reported that one anonymous source said the police investigation showed that the Israeli response helicopter likely fired on Israelis. the police responded to this article casting doubt on this source by saying no such investigation had even been conducted. Even if you believe though, that some civilians were killed accidentally by friendly fire how is Hamas not still responsible? they video taped themselves massacreing civilians, they tossed grenades into bomb shelters where people sheltered, they shot a bunch of seniors at a bus stop, they ran around a music festival laughing and singing while hunting people down hiding in trees and bushes, they tied children to their mothers and set them on fire, they burned people alive in their homes locked in their bomb shelter, they shot kids in their beds in their pjs,  they decapitated a soldier and took his head as a souvenir which they then tried to sell , they paraded a girls body around in a truck to cheers and celebration etc etc and I made sure to only mention the stories that are verified unlike rumors like decapitated babies in ovens  you can't deny this stuff my friend bc they filmed it all PROUDLY

* **Move them south to Saftey from  Gaza City**  
Thus one really makes no sense, they are trying to win a war in Gaza right? they need to take control of the whole strip. they are going territory by territory and conquering. the Hamas fighters that survive flee to the areas still in their control. The civilians fled to Rafah and so did the leaders of Hamas, it's their last stronghold. Israel is trying to evacuate civilians to tent cities north if Rafah but it's a pretty impossible feat,but if Israel doesn't enter Rafah they lose the war. Hamas should really surrender at this point but they won't bc they want the bloodbath in hopes Israel will lose American backing and become vulnerable in future wars. 


* **Rape** 
there are rape victims who survived according to psychologists treating the victims but no one is willing to come forward. However there is a lot of eyewitness testimony which is more than you need to convict in a rape case in court, do you think these random Israeli citizens convened and conspired to tell fake rape stories? Also I've seen a pretty damning video of female corpses from Nova strewn about with their legs spread and naked from the waist down, so yeah that'll be good for me. or maybe they didn't ""rape"" them they just  sexually humiliated them in death for resistance you know


* **De-capitated babies** 
it was a viral rumor that news outlets picked up not an official statement it only became big bc for some reason Biden said he saw a picture of it but Israel never made any statement about this

* **The horror of hostages** \- yeah, who locks up children and woman by the hundreds without trial? And if   in your mind, a 15 year old aint a kid, then .... please don't be a raving hypocrite and  spout on about  your  local pervy school teacher feeling up the 15 or 14 year olds ...

I mean your exaggerating the number of how many female and underage prisoners Israel had definitely not hundreds, but I actually agree with you I don't think administrative detention is fair and should be abolished. the point of it is to give the army the ability to apprehend a terrorist without the delay of needing a warrant and it is supposed to be a temporary hold, but I have no doubt it is abused. that said there are actual dangerous terrorists that Hamas wants to release, Sinwar himself was released in the Gilad Shalit hostage deal


* **Dont shoot innocents** 
the hostages? a soldier freaked out and fucked up. a tragedy. the other videos I'm not convinced are IDF they could easily be Hamas doing intimidation strikes bc there have been plenty of accounts of them shooting at Gazans trying to follow evacuation orders. if there are other incidents they are certainly mistakes, IDF has also killed soldiers in friendly fire. it is a difficult, dense, tense disorienting environment and Hamas uses intentionally deceptive tactics to approach soldiers. 

* **Isolate Hamas by moving the population south** \-
I mean I guess but what's your strategy,based on your military expertise of course? 

* **Free the Hostages from Hamas** \- 
Well this is a criticism many Israelis are making as well, perhaps true but another perspective is that the military pressure creates urgency forcing Hamas into negotiations. in previous hostage situations with Hamas the mediations took years, you could argue the fact that they so badly wanted to release hostages in exchange for a short temporary ceasefire at the beginning of the war was due to the immense military pressure",11/14/2023 10:08,Pro-Israel

For a first time, Hamas official estimates group casualties at 6,000 fighters

Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-six-week-drive-hit-hamas-rafah-scale-back-war-2024-02-19/) today that

&gt;A Hamas official based in Qatar told Reuters that the group estimated it had lost 6,000 fighters during the four-month-old conflict, half the 12,000 Israel says it has killed.

This is the first time during the conflict that Hamas openly admitted to any losses among its troops. Assuming that other militant groups in Gaza (e.g. Islamic Jihad, PFLP, etc) also suffered the same *proportional* losses, this [gives](https://x.com/AdinHaykin1/status/1759514665799848384?s=20) a very conservative estimate of 8,000+ eliminated militants in total. And that's taking their numbers at face value...

This yield a [civilian casualty ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualty_ratio) to 2.65, whereas the Israeli figures suggest a ratio of 1.42. Compare this with the U.S.-led battle against ISIS in Mosul in 2017, where the ratio was [between](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/02/14/gaza-war-israel-civilian-deaths-urban-warfare-hamas/) 1.8â3.7.

I read this part and I kind of laughed. ""It would seem plausible"". I'll keep reading though in good faith.

While there doesn't appear to be a ""command and control center"" - like the one shown in the IDFs video. I think there's more than just:

&gt;a couple of bags of AK47s or a few individual hamas terrorists.

They also found video footage of armed men walking around the hospital, guns out and all, escorting what appeared to be an injured man. Hospital staff can be seen moving out of the way. There's also the testimony of the head of the hospital saying that Hamas was actually there and supposedly he has ties to Hamas.

&gt;US intelligence told CNN that 40-45% of te 29,000 air to surface munitions dropped on Gaza were dumb bombs

I keep seeing this number floating around. What I'm curious is, what is the accuracy compared to a guided missile? Also, is the IDF using these unguided munitions on the same targets that they would use a guided missile for? I think it's a little manipulative to just say well half are unguided so they don't care. We should probably know more information before we just jump and pretend we're now military experts who know what a ""dumb bomb"" is, what the accuracy is, what the particular model of the munition is or situation the IDF has used them in etc.

Similar to the previous example of unguided munitions, like the article points out, most of the 2,000lb bomb craters seem to be on the outskirts (shown in the map), is the IDF saving their ""unguided bombs"" for missions that don't require the same level of precision, is that really that big of a deal as people are making it out to be?

687,"&gt;Well, this will sort of suffer from the same issue - the protests you'll hear about will be the most controversial ones.

I'm talking about protests I've personally been too. It's an argument you've seen a lot from people who try to prove Israel's offensive to be a genocide, and one which was deconstructed by the evacuation.

&gt; We just saw 45 people burned to death and hundreds more wounded because a fire started and they were in tents

You fail to mention several other reasons for that matter; one being this is a zone Israel ordered evacuations for, but wasn't evacuated. The other being the likely presence of a vehicle filled with munitions in the area. A video filmed by Palestinians on the ground in the immediate aftermath of the fire has them suggesting the fire was started by shrapnel hitting a vehicle filled with munitions.  
Said shrapnel was studied, and it's suggested Israel likely used a type of bomb specifically designed to limit civilian casualties. In this instance, the fault on the fire falls on Hamas for storing munitions in a civilian area in the first place, and it perfectly proves just why a Rafah offensive is a must, and why Rafah needs to be evacuated.  

Hamas proved time and time again they are happy to hide among civilians, and won't stop doing so. The only way to actually move forward towards a permanent resolution to this war is by seperating them from the civilians and taking them down, and that cannot be achieved without evacuating Rafah.  

I can see you'd probably suggest some sort of ""permanent ceasefire"", but such a solution is essentially just kicking the can down the road. Hamas openly stated that if they are let to keep ruling Gaza, they would just rearm and attack again. If you listen to any of their talks in Arabic, they specifically refer to the possibility of a ceasefire with the term ""Hudna"", which is an Islamist term which refers to a type of ceasefire where the believers stop their Jihad, but only to rearm and attack again.  

&gt;That's clearly a very legitimate reason to object to the invasion of Rafah.

That's a valid argument. But I fail to see why the argument shouldn't be to provide these needs better rather than nulling any offensive, which just serves to do exactly what I spoke of above. 

&gt;The better quality it had was that it was the one place that hadn't been bombed into dust.

Again, that doesn't prove in any way that it is better than Al Mawasi. If you were to speak of its proximity to the Rafah crossing I'd understand, but fact of the matter is, Rafah has been bombed far more extensively than Al Mawasi, and either way, the displaced people living there aren't living in the city itself. Like I said before, Rafah was a city of 171K before the war. Before the evacuations, it housed 1.5 million. The fact that the city center is more intact than other parts of Gaza doesn't make the tent city that sprawled outside any better. Like I said before, if anything, a humanitarian zone specifically designed to house a large number of displaced people is far better suited for this than the outskirts of Rafah.  

&gt;I think you might be labouring under the false impression that it is safe or has adequate facilities.

I don't think it's either of those. I acknowledge no part of Gaza is perfectly safe nor has the most adequate facilities. What I'm challenging is your view that Rafah is better, despite no tangible proof of the matter, and proof of the opposite. Al Mawasi isn't a perfect paradise, but fact of the matter is it has been built up specifically for that purpose, while Rafah only became a refuge by default. Al Mawasi hosts the most field hospitals in Gaza, it's a center of distribution for aid, and hosts many more facilities to meet those needs better.",11/12/2023 17:21,Pro-Israel
688,"&gt;Whatâs happening in Palestine is not a war. Innocent people are losing their lives, children are being bombed and starved to death, not receiving enough humanitarian aid, women are having miscarriages and having c sections without anesthesia.

Are you saying it's unusual for innocents to suffer in war?

Also nearly 1000 IDF soldiers have been killed and Hamas fired rockets into Tel Aviv a few months ago. Hamas still holds hostages and hasn't surrendered yet. There is very much ongoing fighting between both sides - one side, is just losing.

&gt;Palestinians are completely defenseless and do not have a military to protect them but Israelis do. Israelis have access to basic necessities like clean water and food while Palestinians do not.

The issue is that Palestine does have a fighting force; Hamas just actively want their own civilians to die. They embed themselves within the civilian population (refugee camps, residential buildings, hospitals) to protect themselves and their weaponry and fire rockets from civilian areas. Hamas themselves has said that they [benefit from the civilian death toll](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/11/middleeast/sinwar-hamas-israel-ceasefire-hostage-talks-intl/index.html#:~:text=The%20military%20leader%20of%20Hamas,newspaper%20said%20it%20had%20seen).

There are so many problems with our activism culture today. Oh my god.

(WARNING: RANT INCOMING)

Activism culture has become strangely individualistic. Itâs not just about the cause, itâs about **yourself** in relation to the cause, for so many people. Everyone feels like they need to have the loudest voice â even if they are not at all personally affected nor knowledge about the subject.

Youâll hear the phrase âwe are all Palestinianâ coming from non-Palestinians, and like, no, youâre not. Donât try to claim someone elseâs trauma or pain as your own because you feel bad. Or youâll hear a white (culturally Christian) American saying âIâve been so affected by this personally,â and itâs like, no, you have been *affected* by this, sure, but you have not been *personally* affected or *directly* impacted. You can feel emotional about something without making it about you.

Because people want to have the loudest voice, even if they know nothing, theyâll spread misinformation. Theyâll say Israelis all have a second country to go back to. No, 78% of Jewish Israelis were born there. Someone referred to the Nakba as âthe death.â It means âcatastrophe,â btw. Theyâll say âStarbucks funds genocide!â Starbucks has no financial connection to Israel whatsoever. Someone said Britain gave Palestine to Israel after the Holocaust. No, the UN created the 1947 partition plan; the UK helped facilitate Jewish immigration in the 1920s-30s, but by 1940 they were actively stopping Jews from entering and against the formation of a Jewish state.

This individualistic âeveryone needs to be involvedâ culture also leads to a lot of performative activism and virtue signaling. Like, people resharing that same AI-generated âAll Eyes on Rafahâ image over and over has the same exact energy as people posting a black square for BLM.

You can be involved with Israel-Palestine without having the loudest voice. If you donât have the time or mental energy to do a lot of background research, you donât have to do that either. Instead of posting something yourself and possibly misinforming people, you can reshare a post from someone actually involved. You can donate money. (From Gaza, the orgs HEAL Palestine, Rebuilding Alliance, eSIMS for Gaza, INARA, and Gaza Community Mental Health all seem safe and legit from research Iâve done. For Israel, thereâs IsraAID, Hamaniot, the Hostages and Missing Family Forum, and the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel.)

And, finally, like you said, there is *so much self-righteousness!* These people think so highly of themselves, and anyone who disagrees with anything they do or say must be morally reprehensible. No exaggeration. If someone tells a pro-Palestine protestor that something theyâve done is antisemitic, they say youâre just pro-genocide. Like, I want a ceasefire and an end to the massacre of Gazans too, but claiming that AIPAC controls the government is antisemitic, the âfrom the river to the seaâ calls are calls for violence against Israelis, and Hamas is still antisemitic and evil. Pointing that out does not make me âpro-genocide.â I hate Netanyahu and the current IDF too.

And the self-righteous also comes with so much self-victimization. A heard a cishet, culturally Christian, white man, from a financially well-off family (this is someone I know) saying how he and his friends had been made into âpersona non grataâ and speaking about how they would not be silenced. Like, sir, look at yourselfâYOU. ARE. NOT. *OPPRESSED.*

The people actually engaged in the rape, torture, mutilation, murder, and kidnapping of the Israeli civilians were kind enough to send videos of what they did to the victims' families using the victims' cell phones - and to also post those videos to telegram so their own friends and neighbors in Gaza could enjoy the show.  That's what people were watching in those videos of the Gaza streets on the morning of October 7, of everyone glued to their phones, smiling and cheering.

Later, the IDF compiled a video of what they found when they cleared the kibbutzim that were attacked, and the music festival, and showed that video to a room full of journalists.  Some cried, some were sick, others had to leave the room.

...but not Gazans.  The same video was leaked, and Hamas obtained a copy and showed it to a crowd outside the al Shifa hospital.  There's video of that too - and of that crowd cheering.

We know that Israel is regularly attacked by female and child terrorists, that Hamas uses child soldiers, and that the IDF has encountered female suicide bombers in Gaza - and that they have found explosive vests adapted for children.

The IDF has found weapons caches in schools and hospitals, weapons factories in civilian apartment buildings, and captured Hamas terrorists have confessed that Hamas uses hospitals as command centers.  We have video of their using ambulances to transport terrorists.

So, if you were to separate out the people in Gaza who were terrorists or would be if they had the opportunity, from those who are not, I think you would have one group of very young children, and almost everyone else in the other group.",11/11/2023 13:03,Pro-Israel

And that person also reported that Hamas was parading around with victimsâ heads on spikes. Nobody takes that seriously, so this is obviously not a credible witness. No rape kits were used to investigate rape and no video evidence of rape was shown.
2. There are constant reports by Palestinian women of systematic rape in Israeli prisons, so yes, they already rape Palestinian women
3. If there was any rape, it would be categorically condemned by every Palestinian and every supporter of Palestine. 
4. On the other hand, Jake Shields writes âIâm often controversial and have gotten several dozen death threats over the years.

Yes. Yes they do. Havenât you seen the images of Israelis sitting on park chairs and cheering every time a bomb drops on Gaza? 90% of the Israeli population is all for the genocide.

Also â¦ why were the candies given? Why was it a day of joy? Did the candy givers SAY they were happy because of innocent civilians killed? Or were they celebrating a military victory? Were they celebrating the first time the prisoners of Gaza managed to break through their prison walls? Were they celebrating an act of resistance against an occupier?

Simply not true.

&gt;False, local Palestinian Arabs took crucial roles as local participants as well as local Bedouins in the Sinai and Palestine campaign.

Bedouins did, Palestinians didnât; source it if you want to change my mind.

&gt;The british paid local tribes to fight on their side.  Native palestinians fought in the Arab Revolt all over Palestine during the Arab Revolt.

Thereâs no evidence to these claims that I could ever find.

&gt;Again, a meaningless undefined term.

As much as native homeland.

&gt;European colonials will colonize I guess, nothing too surprising about that.

Still talking about Arabs.

&gt;All of that is ridiculously false.  Though, at a time when it was under the Egyptian empire the name Peleset, did become the name for the region ~4-5,000 years ago, when it was still Canaan...

Lmao, if you say itâs false without offering any basis for it then surely it must be.

Palestinians have zero historical continuity with the Philistines.

&gt;But then something happened to the Canaanites...  Wonder what happened to them, they seemed nice...

They were assimilated into Israelites and Maronites which emerged from them.

&gt;You're the one that's been wrong about everything, as you are in this instance.

Nothing you said has disproven anything I said, stating Iâm wrong doesnât change reality.

&gt;It wasn't under an empire in ~1834-1835 or ~1099-1244

You think that the Crusader wars, an explicitly imperial struggle over the whole area, changes the substance of my comment, and one year after a thousand? Really?

&gt;So, continuing your tradition, you were wrong about that as you were wrong about everything else.

My point stands.

&gt;Some time you might consider taking the tiniest bit of interest in the history of Palestine.  Maybe you'd find it interesting.

Lmao, preach.

&gt;Wrong as you are, I think you're projecting.

This is getting tiresome, youâve said nothing again.

&gt;So you believe the Christian Crusades were moral?

No more or less moral than the preceding and succeeding empires.

&gt;The Ur of Chaldes in Babylonia, now modern Iraq?

The Bible isnât a historical document; âsome time you might consider taking the tiniest bit of interest in the history of Palestine.â

&gt;Again, you're wrong.  You're on a roll...  10/10 consistency.

Thatâs actually you, even with this very statement.

&gt;False.  Bedouins lived everywhere, and the habitable land then, as now, was mostly fully utilized, as was the consensus of the british administration at the time.

Bedouins are a separate group from Palestinians.

The inhabited land map is readily available to disprove your point and substantiate my own, again âsome time you might consider taking the tiniest bit of interest in the history of Palestine.â

&gt;The negev remains mostly unpopulated other than by nomads, and most peat bogs/swamps have been reflooded, as while draining them was simply a matter of finding a mark to fund the pointless endeavor of pumping the water out, the foreign zionist immigrants were never smart enough to figure out how to put out the peat fires that plagued the drained peat bogs, other than to find some other mark to fund reflooding the peat bogs.

This does not prove your point whatsoever, whatever this is supposed to be.

&gt;You do in europe, or russia, or wherever you were from before you invaded

You may want that to be the case, but the fact is Iâm self determining right here in my native homeland, the only place I ever called home.

&gt;Palestine and violated the self-determination of native Palestinians.

There is no Palestine.

&gt;And yet, hypocritically, you believe that claims unjustified in seizing terrorist european zionist land, is justified by terrorist european zionists in seizing native Palestinian land...

&gt;Curious, isn't it?

Not really, Israel existing leaves room for Palestine existing; not the other way around.

I believe that a genocidal civil war warrants seizing of land, when Israel starts killing Palestinians for being Palestinians is when Iâll change my views; or maybe if I keep talking to enough people like you Iâll agree with it.

&gt;False.  For some reason, there's lots of undeveloped land in the european terrorist colony of israel,

No such thing as âEuropean terrorist colony of Israelâ is what I meant, obviously I didnât mean thereâs no empty land in Israel.

&gt;for some reason they keep sending violent terrorists into the Palestinian West Bank, leaving their terrorist colony with large swaths of undeveloped land.

The settlers are there of their own volition, as opposed as I am to that.

&gt;They may have learned some things from the violent european zionist terrorist invaders.

Other way around.

&gt;Well, no.  The goal of the terrorist bombing was to try, but fail to destroy evidence tying david ben-gurion, the jewish agency and the terrorist haganah to acts of violent terrorism and the terrorist irgun/herut/likud...

Absolute Speculation bordering on conspiracy.

&gt;Because nobody would ever want to be tied to menachem begins terrorist irgun/herut/likud.

I know I wouldnât but thatâs a matter of my personal flavor of politics.

Killed over a thousand Hamas fighters and even rescued hostages who were being held in civilian homes. Right now in Sudan a city  roughly the size of Gaza is under siege. There are no airlifts.

3. Israel been holding thousands and thousands of hostages (aka prisoners) for years and torturing them. Look up the Landau commission. They use Holocaust to justify their atrocities. Human rights have been condemning the torture of prisoners for years. The PCATI has been documenting torture for years and nobody dares say a word about it.

4. Just another whataboutism, that justifies the use of 2 2000 pound bombs over the refugee camp of Jabalia. 

5. Those same extremists are controlling the country and all âoperationsâ. So why donât Israelis do something about it? Simply because theyâre mostly on board with the atrocities. You cab check the polls for yourself.

Hamas fighters wore body-cams. The area was blanketed with CCTV cameras. The festival also had numerous CCTV cameras, so where are the videos of the mass random killings? There should be hundreds. 

Hamas obviously did intentionally murder civilians on October 7. But how many? Thereâs a huge difference between 70 and 700. How many were killed unintentionally, caught in crossfire? How many were killed by Israeli helicopter gunships? How many were killed by hellfire missiles and tanks?

(December 4, 2023 / JNS)
Hamasâs brutal slaughter of more than 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 represents âsome of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity,â International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan said on Sunday as he concluded a visit to the Jewish state.

Khan traveled to Israel at the request of families whose loved ones were murdered or taken hostage by terrorist groups based in the Gaza Strip, the prosecutor announced in a blog post on Sunday. Jerusalem does not recognize the courtâs jurisdiction over the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

âIn both Kibbutz Beeri and Kibbutz Kfar Azza, as well as at the site of the Nova Music Festival in Reâim, I witnessed scenes of calculated cruelty,â wrote Khan, vowing to work in partnership with victimsâ families âas part of our ongoing work to hold those responsible to account.â

He called for the âimmediate and unconditionalâ release of the estimated 137 hostages who remain in Hamas captivity, citing in particular âthe egregious breach of fundamental principles of humanity through the taking and continued holding of children.â

Commenting on Israelâs military operation against Hamas terrorists in Gaza, Khan noted that the Israel Defense Forces âhas trained lawyers who advise commanders and a robust system intended to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law.

âConflict in densely populated areas where fighters are alleged to be unlawfully embedded in the civilian population is inherently complex, but international humanitarian must still apply and the Israeli military knows the law that must be applied,â said the prosecutor.",7/16/2024 14:00,Pro-Israel

There is no civilian bombing or casualty or collateral damage or âtargetâ that will prevent me from changing my mind. Theyâve brought it on themselves, like the Nazis. This is evil. 

If I imagine that happening to my family, I imagine I would do anything necessary to wipe those people off the planet. Do you know that the average Palestinian does not differ much from a Hamas terrorist in terms of their life philosophy? Do you really understand antisemitism, in itâs true form? Kids are being taught to hate Jews in school. It is not portrayed the western media. I say this as a physician who was educated in the states, is secular and atheist, and has read Chomsky and Vidal and every other founder of the philosophy that you are following (you probably donât know), and at one point I even thought it was cool. 

Iâll just give you an aside. As a kid growing up in San Francisco in the 90âs a lot of people wore Che Guevara t-shirts and it was cool. It was as cool as Nirvana. Except it turns out Che would have literally nuked us if he could. Literally would have pushed the button, and the conversations with Castro, with Che almost chomping at the bit to get permission from the Russians, is very well documented.

774,"Letâs rewind a little bit because this conversation started with me saying that a lot of the organizations behind these protests are deeply problematic and basically not actually promoting what students say they (students) want. 
From there, I think youâve imagined what my position is and attacked from that perspective.
The fact of the matter is in the past few weeks, Iran, Hamas, Houthis, David Duke have stood with student protests. I do not believe the majority of students support these bigots. Definitely a tiny percentage do. However, I do know that (whether itâs for ideological or strategic reasons) if you take a look at the people, beliefs, and guidelines behind these protesting organizations, there is high crossover between them and Muslim brotherhood and Hamas ideology and even material support. Donât take my word for it and donât shoot the messenger. You can look it up yourself. 
As for Israel, a few far right politicians have said horrible things about Palestinians because terrible people exist in all societies. They have largely been called out and Iâve seen a lot of these quotes free Palestine people are using that often uses âtheyâ. âTheyâ could be the Palestinian people but itâs just as reasonable to assume âtheyâ mean Hamas, when the âPalestinian peopleâ are not explicitly named. This is a huge reason why the ICJ could not prove intent of genocide and could not call it that. Itâs also the fact that this is still a war with two combatants. Israel vs Hamas. The Palestinian people to both are collateral damage and I think thatâs horrible and creating a humanitarian disaster. The current treaty that Egypt, US, Hamas, and Israel are talking through if the source is accurate includes, 20-40 Palestinians free (including actually convicted people) PER hostage, cessation of air raids, and Israel rebuilding the hospitals and major infrastructure in Gaza. Hamas says no. Israel is mostly out of most of Gaza with only one brigade in the central corridor to fight off Hamas from trying to return. What remains is Rafah. From a humanitarian position, I think itâs terrible but from a military position I understand why because thatâs the last stronghold of Hamas leadership and if leadership remains I believe them when they said theyâd keep doing Oct 7 style attacks. Thatâs a problem. But peopleâs lives matter too and thatâs why Iâm not a politician.
Last points: US Aid is only 16% of Israelâs military budget. So not that much. I support defensive aid but not aid for striking. But itâs a pipe dream that the US will fully divest. Israel is too strategic against Iran for both the West and Arab nations and is too key for tech and military industries. Itâs not happening the way students think it can. This isnât South Africa. Rumors are that Saudi Arabia is about to announce normalization with Israel. I think this could end the war faster, possibly root out Hamas faster, and establish a true path for statehood. The protest themselves tbh are almost irrelevant beyond the campus and media and our own internal politics, but I still support students expressing themselves but they need to be way more informed. In reality what is needed now is mobilization for rebuilding Gaza, helping them avoid starvation, and maybe some organizations for building a strong civil societyâ¦fundraising and pressuring institutions to create programs that fund and support Palestinian students is constructiveâ¦yelling at them to cancel Israeli study abroad programs and disclose purposefully complicated investments is not constructive.",6/30/2024 20:00,Neutral

782,"I always describe the Arab-Israeli conflict as a ""Tangled ball of yarn"".  
There are so many layers and actors, some are rational, some are irrational.  
First of all - any player in this conflict tries to ""Pull"" the situation towards themselves.  
Secondly, some of the things I'll mention are more of a speculation or analysis and not just facts.

The situation is Rafah has goals:  
Eliminate completely Hamas-ISIS as organization and leaders.  
and Bring back the victims - the hostages that Hamas-ISIS has kidnapped.

What's the problem?  
Gaza is small, the civilians have no real wiggle room- now the IDF has designated some more areas and it has ""Humanitarian area"" in the West of Han Yunes still exists.  
The sad fact is that Hamas-ISIS uses this region to shoot rockets, to eliminate them there's no other way than a military foot operation.

What's the catch?  
Well many assume and are terrified that the civilians in Gaza would suffer even more with such action.  
The world isn't providing a sustainable solution to Hamas-ISIS, they just want to accept their existence and move on and Israel also cannot accept that. Without real partnership and sustainable solutions Israel can't go forward.

What other political problems that affect the conflict?

* The upcoming elections in the US are making the Biden administrative more sensitive to this topic, every action of Israel seems to be under a microscope.
* Bibi (Israel prime minister) has his own issues and I suspect he wants to continue this war to remain in power and continue his own political agendas. The fact that it's the most right wing government of Israel in history doesn't help Israel in this war. Best case scenario for Bibi is that his actions in the last 10 years are remain unchecked and he is in better position to run again. Worst case scenario, an investigation reveals his true actions in the last years and he is no longer able to run for public high profile jobs or even get jail time. (In his age I doubt it)
* Another point on Bibi's government, it showed a remarkable failure in the 7th october. It seems Bibi's officials castrated the government and its ability to provide solutions to the citizens. So I suspect it has no capability to actually provide a real and final solution to Gaza. As I mentioned this is a pretty much right wing government and I'm afraid some people in the government want to gain something personal from this war.
* Egypt and the Arab world - I suspect nobody there actually cares what happens in Gaza but they need to ""Pay their price"" to seem that they contribute or affect Israel, Egypt, Iran and Lebanon has some tendencies to remain a ""global player"" and want to show their influence in the region.

So what's the solution from Israel perspective?  
It cannot disengage although it wants to, Israel knows that it must fight to eliminate the threats or all this 7 months war was in-vain.  
It seems the only solution is the continuation of the war to continue eliminating Hamas elite members.

What's the solution from Hamas-Isis perspective?  
It's of course an irrational player, if it had been a rational player the war would not even started.  
Hamas leaders - Sinwar, wants to remain in power and come victorious just to prove he can.  
In his rational mind he wants to free the terrorists from Israeli jails.  
I'd just remind everyone some of these terrorists have actual blood on their hands - they are criminals.

A quick read through can show you just on Wiki the history of terrorism:

Very interesting to also see Zionist terrorism mentioned here (along with many other countries and factions) 

""Following theÂ 1929 Hebron massacreÂ of 67 Jews in theÂ Mandate of Palestine, theÂ ZionistÂ militiaÂ HaganahÂ transformed itself into a paramilitary force. In 1931, however, the more militantÂ IrgunÂ broke away from Haganah, objecting to Haganah's policy ofÂ restraint.[125]Â Founded byÂ Avraham Tehomi,[126][127]Â Irgun sought to aggressively defend Jews from Arab attacks. *Its tactic of attacking Arab communities, including the bombing of a crowded Arab market, is among the first examples of terrorism directed against civilians*.[128]Â After the British published theÂ White Paper of 1939, which placed strict restrictions onÂ Jewish immigration into PalestineÂ (which was seen as unacceptable to Zionist groups),[129]Â the Irgun began a campaign against the British authorities by assassinating police, capturing British government buildings and arms, and sabotaging railways.[130]Â Irgun's best-known attackÂ targeted theÂ King David HotelÂ in Jerusalem, parts of which housed the headquarters of the British civil and military administrations. The bombing, in 1946, killed ninety-one people and injured forty-six, making it the most deadly attack during the Mandate era. This attack was sharply condemned by the organized leadership of theÂ Yishuv, and further widened the gulf betweenÂ David Ben-Gurion'sÂ HaganaÂ and Begin's Irgun. Following the bombing, Ben-Gurion called Irgun an ""enemy of the Jewish people"".[131][132]Â After theÂ Israeli Declaration of IndependenceÂ in 1948,Â Menachem BeginÂ (Irgun leader from 1943 to 1948) transformed the group into the political partyÂ Herut, which later became part ofÂ LikudÂ in an alliance with the center-rightÂ Gahal,Â Liberal Party,Â Free Centre,Â National List, andÂ Movement for Greater Israel.[133][134]Â On the 60th anniversary of the bombing, a plaque was unveiled at the hotel.[135]""",6/18/2024 15:51,Pro-Palestine

794,"I think thatâs a distinction without a difference. If Hamas surrendered all of its weapons rockets and materiel, that would eliminate Hamasâ capacity to challenge Israeli security, but thatâs basically what annihilation aims to do. The war aim is to not have any Hamas fighters able to fire a gun or rocket. You can either remove the fighters, the guns, or ideally both. Hamas wonât turn over the guns so you remove the fighters. Thatâs annihilation. I laid out the problems with this war aim, it means you canât negotiate with the enemy and need to achieve unconditional surrender, and if the enemy resists you have to grind them down. If you take the view that all civilian casualties are incidental and the greatest care is being taken to protect civilians (I donât take that view personally), the war aim calls for enormous civilian casualties. American public is already 55% against the Israeli operation and Rafah has barely begun, what happened when aid shortages pick up again, polling goes to 70% against, and Biden has to pull the plug or lose in November?

I donât understand your last point, there was never a chance of Israel carpet bombing Gaza to smithereens or nuking Gaza like that one loudmouth Israeli minister suggested. The diplomatic repercussions would be too great. Sanctions almost for sure plus anti-Israel protests everywhere. Therefore, the fact that Israel *hasnât* flattened Gaza is not evidence that flattening Gaza wouldnât achieve Israelâs aim. It just means Israel faces constraints beyond just the practical number of bombs and munitions it has available.",6/15/2024 17:01,Pro-Israel
795,"&gt; Since the October attacks at least 10,000 of Gazaâs children have been killed. Thatâs more than three 9/11s, but literally all the victims being children. 

I think it's a very sick way of presenting the military operation. Mainly due to two factors:

1. The credibility of the number of children and women is not the best, people have noticed multiple days in a row where seemingly only women and children died, and multiple days where the number of women and children grew more than the total casualties.

2. You completely ignore the fact that (depending on who you believe) 6,000-12,000 casualties are terrorists.

This means that the civilian to militant death ratio is between 4:1 and 2:1 which are both pretty good for this kind of urban warfare

&gt; Civilians are not safe in ambulances, schools or hospitals or even zones designated by the Israeli government to be safe like the entire city of Rafah

Yes, when terrorists use ambulances, schools, and hospitals, they loose their protected status.

As for safe zones, it works the same way. If you designate a safe zone, terrorists will hide there, and so eventually you'll have to attack what was previously a safe zone.

These are all thing that should be trivial to understand for someone who served in a military.

&gt; It is better to free a guilty man than it is to sentence and innocent one

Unfortunately that sentiment doesn't work in any war. Mainly because it misses an important factor:

Is it better to free a guilty man **knowing fully well that he'll repeat his violent crimes** than it is to sentence both him and an innocent one to jail?

796,It will. Palestine will be free,6/13/2024 10:41,Pro-Palestine
797,"&gt;For this I suggest reading a recentÂ [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/famine-review-committee-review-famine-early-warning-systems-network-fews-net-ipc-compatible-analysis-northern-governorates-gaza-strip-conclusions-and-recommendations-may-2024)Â published by the Famine Review Committee which found that there was no evidence to support the analysis provided by the IPC or famine in general. AÂ [similar report](https://www.gov.il/en/pages/transparency-and-methodology-issues-in-the-ipc-special-brief-of-18-march-2024#1)Â also reviewed what details were ignored by the IPC resulting in incorrect food insecurity classifications.

See my other [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1do8ine/comment/la86cbf/)

I took a look at the FRC report in June (the most recently published report) and while the report does say famine is not occurring, it does say that ""the situation in GazaÂ **remains catastrophic**Â and there is a high and sustained risk of Famine across the whole Gaza Strip."" The FRC stressed to individual stakeholders that,

&gt;The FRC encourages all stakeholders who use the IPC for high-level decision-making to understand thatÂ **whether a Famine classification is confirmed or not does not in any manner change the fact that extreme human suffering is without a doubt currently ongoing in the Gaza Strip, and does not change the immediate humanitarian imperative to address this civilian suffering**Â by enabling complete, safe, unhindered, and sustained humanitarian access into and throughout the Gaza Strip, including through ceasing hostilities. All actors should not wait until a Famine classification is made to act accordingly.

Furthermore, if you take a look at the FRC analysis of individual areas and sectors of Gaza just further down, you'll find all of them from Gaza to Rafah have a current classification of IPC Phase 4 ""Emergency Acute Food Insecurity"" meaning the situation is still dire. Mind you, Phase 4 is just one level from outright disaster. According to the FRC's own definition of Phase 4 Emergency, it says

&gt;""Households either:  
â¢ Have large food consumption gaps which are reflected in very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality; or  
â¢ Are able to mitigate large food consumption gaps but only by employing emergency livelihood strategies and asset liquidation.""

TLDR: IIRC, the allegation against Israel is that there is a massive risk of famine and acute food security due to restrictions on aid entering Gaza and closer of various crossings which seems what the FRC report confirmed. All governates in Gaza including Deir Al-Balah, Gaza City, and Khan Yunis are currently facing Phase 4 Emergency food insecurities, just one level below full-blown famine/catastrophe. The report didn't prove it was all rainbows and sunshine in Gaza as most pro-Israelis would like to believe, it proved there is still a massive risk of famine and food hunger that needs to be addressed by every nation and organization. In simpler terms, yes the report didn't prove famine is happening in Gaza, it proved Gaza is on the brink of a famine and still has acute food shortages (which is not exactly the most comforting answer)",6/13/2024 3:10,Neutral

Or hear me out when the US asked for Netanyahu to share his plan for the Rafah operations, the humanitarian situation to get civilians out of the way, and the day after plan, Netanyahu couldn't provide a coherent answer and the Biden admin finds that very hard to support.

Stopping shipments when the fighting was the fiercest? No not at all. Netanyahu, Gvir, and Smotrich have actively been ""clowning"" the US and isolating Israel through words and actions consistently throughout the conflict.

However, some people who have managed to get to the other side have been Hamas terrorists and their families, N12 said, as the report claims that money is not an issue for the terrorist organization's relatives.

812,"I struggle to understand those that make a moral distinction that terrorists violence is more immoral than state sponsored violence.

Thereâs a false air of civility that is caused by the distance and detached nature of modern warfare when the violence is carried out by a well equipped professional army.

Where as people storming over a border with little more than a motorbike and a gun immediately conjures up images of barbarism.

But in real life, is there really a material difference if your child burned to death in a drone strike or by a terrorist? 

Really the morality comes from the material results of those impacted by the violence. Those who are innocent being killed and maimed.

As humans we generally agree that killing certain people in a war is immoral - civilians, children, elderly. Thatâs why there was wide spread disgust at the October terrorist attack but also widespread disgust at how Israelâs retaliation has developed.

Neither side holds a moral high ground in this war, because both have killed unacceptable amounts of civilians and neither had it before the war, they both have blood on their hands and itâs sadly the children who barely understand what is happening that suffer. 

But there is no denying the material reality if who is killing the most right now. 

This is not an even war between two great standing armyâs, but one between one of the most well equipped standing armies on earth and a militia trapped and embedded within a enclaved city whose population are not allowed to leave.

I believe that Israel - as the far superior power, with billions worth of western weapons, as a wealthy democratic nation that shares western morality has a deep responsibility to respond proportionally and with long term peace in mind.

This is clearly not happening.

It is now abundantly clear that the immediate national security threat to Israel has been contained, they have killed more than 10 times those killed in the initial attack. Gaza is a third world hell hole of rubble. Yet the leadership in Israel is pursuing onwards into incredibly immoral grounds, launching an attack in Rafah where millions will be caught in the cross fire.

Israel and evidence? You have to be joking, they release âevidenceâ every week then delete it and change their story, this happened like 10 times since their attack on the first hospital. Israel's âevidenceâ is the one that gets debunked 30 minutes after they release it, donât skim through Western pages and then pretend that you know about this conflict my friend. Israelâs âevidenceâ is the most laughable crap on this Earth. They once filmed a paper with a calendar in Arabic, claiming it was the names of Hamas fighters who have shifts there. When they killed 3 of their people, they first denied it and released a random video of âHamas fighters killing themâ, then actually confessed of doing it.

So please donât get started on poorly made âevidenceâ. Israel's video doesnât show the whole picture and there are many expert talks of it being edited as well.

Israel is not a democracy at all, unless you can be a democracy and run apartheid on occupied areas or be occupying areas to begin with.  And about free press, then why do they arrest protestors and activists? They claim itâs âhate crimesâ, because they are against the genocide in Gaza.

So my friend, go educate yourself and learn about the truth from the oppressed, not the terrorist oppressor. So you donât look like a fool infront of people with actual knowledge about the incident.

The number of Arab villages depopulated or destroyed during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the subsequent establishment of the state of Israel is a subject of historical debate and varies depending on the sources and criteria used.

Hamas has for 20 years embedded itself in every single part of gaza, almost every school, hospital, mosque and civilian block has either weapons in it or a tunnel shaft, Hamas never wears any uniform making it impossible to distinguish between them and civilians. They deliberately conduct their military apparatus next to civilians because they WANT their civilians to die. Hamas are the ones who decided to start this war not Israel, Netanyahu for years was trying to appease Hamas so they can keep the peace.

Hezbollah is launching missiles into the north of Israel. 100,000 people are displaced. Hezbollah is now encouraged to attack again. Both groups want israel destroyed.

Note: This does not mean israel has to do better for the civilians.

Also: Israel took over the Rafah border a few weeks ago to stop hamas from smuggling weapons through it. Egypt has since blocked shipments of food to Gazans. Its why the US tried to build that pier (they did a shitty job and it fell apart). Israel is not totally innocent. Far right wingers are destroying some food shipments. To compare to Poland/Ukraine its less than far right poles destroyed of Ukrainian Grain. Does not make it right and they should be arrested. 

on top of that you can find tons of videos of hamas stealing food from trucks. Then shooting civilians who try to get food. Israel can't put soldiers on those trucks it make them a target. If israel shoots back its massive civilian casualties. 

Israel does need to do a better job getting aid in through Israel. But they really need the Rafah crossing too. There is also no plan for a post hamas government. Netanyahu is ignoring that.

Also seems like the hostages are absolutely fucked. It's not that Israel doesn't care, but that there's parts of the government that find it more convenient to have it as an excuse to continue the excursion into Rafah. I think they might still do it even with hostages returned, but it would be harder due to international pressure. Maybe if Hamas offered the hostages back, they'd accept, but it doesn't seem like they're going to go out of their way to really try and rescue all the hostages. Maybe a few because that would be good for publicity?

Palestinians in Gaza are also fucked. There's way too many people that are deluded by how much control the international community and the US  has on Israel. I don't think they're going to stop unless there's actual solutions in the form of US intervention setting boots on the ground as a neutral party. And that's not going to happen. It's sad because Palestine supporters only offer wasted money and lip service, and somehow rely on Israel, as the opposing party, to somehow regulate itself.

You may be interested in a recent [Dan Senor podcast with Israeli correspondent Haviv Rettig Gur](https://tinyurl.com/3h7ryskc) where Rettig Gur believes Israel has won the war decisively and explains how and why, contrasting that to the Biden and U.S. misreading of the situation that itâs a stalemate and quagmire with nothing but civilian casualties to show for the effort (thus pressure not to invade Rafah, need for ceasefire).  The discussion on this podcast was much more consistent with your outlook than most opinion you hear in the U.S.  

BTW, I was in Israel most of February and May this year doing volunteer work on military bases and in the Gaza Envelope and was impressed by the mobilization, resolve and morale I observed of both military people and those doing support work.  They certainly donât behave like a society thatâs losing the war or has major questions about the need to decisively defeat Hamas.  People are gung ho, especially reservists who are voluntarily returning and going back to soldier, lots in their 40s, 50s and even 60s.  Even though some have questions about objectives viz. hostages vs. ceasefire etc. and most hate Netanyahu and the political circus, I was impressed.

It's worth noting that Yahya Sinwar himself was released in the Gilad Shalit exchange. It is simple calculus that the lives of a hundred abductees are not worth the lives of potentially thousands of Israelis who would perish in future attacks.

It's 100% clear that all of the doctors who work in Gaza see Hamas inside the hospitals, but that they don't report that for multiple reasons with different ones for each doctor.

* becuase they can actually be shot whilst in Gaza
* because they are still there or intending to go back and fear the consequences
* fear of not being allowed back and be able to treat their patients
* because they are politically selected and actually support the Hamas terrorists

A journalists job *should* be to find out which and how often each of these reasons apply, Clear evidence:

* [actual interview with a doctor testifying to the threat from Hamas against doctors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRFrMV1BBj0) 
* [UK newspaper article validating and covering more detail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12770641/gaza-al-shifa-hospital-british-doctor-claim-hamas-warning.html)

There was an attempt to do it with Egypt, but they fear the same thing. They also don't want the Gazans there.

In addition, Hamas already shot Palestinians who tried to escape the north, so they will fight any force that enters - as you suggested, btw.

Also, the trust Israel has with the UN is zero, actually less of possible because there is true suspicion about the UN.  
Israel won't trust any security to the hands of the UN. So all points regarding UN won't happen - maybe a different international force that is agreed with Israel.


Also, the point of just defending doesn't make any sense. Israel should wait to attack it and just defend without attacking back the source? Why? If thousands of missles shot at Israe, Israell should do what? Never attack back to prevent it?  Doesn't make sense and will never happen.  For example - after 10/7 - what the defense method?

897,"I don't fully understand Palestinian supporters' argument about ""the way Israel has treated Palestinians in the name of self-defense."" There are still 8000 Hamas members in Rafah who are eager to harm Israel and Israeli civilians. The job of the Israeli government is to protect those civilians. Israel is certainly required to do its best to avoid Palestinian civilian casualties, but quite clearly, the job of eliminating all -- or at least most -- Hamas members is not yet complete. Israel hasn't yet succeeded in maximizing the safety and security of its people.

I find that the subtext of a lot of pro-Palestinian arguments is something along with the lines of, ""Israel has to live beside Hamas, and stop its attacks, because eliminating Hamas is too damaging to the Palestinian civilians."" I don't really follow that argument. WHY exactly does Israel have to live beside Hamas? Isn't the job of protecting the Palestinian people the job of... the government of the people of Gaza? That gov't led its people into war against Israel, and now it's the job of Israel to restrain itself as it struggles to protect its own people? That's very, very odd. Even when the US was beating up on Iraq or Afghanistan, you only heard arguments like that occasionally, even though the US may have killed 300,000 Iraqi civilians. The fact that people get so wound up about Israel--and not other nations--not the US, not Russia, not China, not North Korea -- stuff like that makes me very, very suspicious. Something clearly annoys people up about Israel, a tiny little country. I wonder what that thing could be? Why ISRAEL? Why not Syria? Remember the outbreak of anti-Assad protests all across campuses in the US and abroad? No, I don't either.

It's a nasty war, no doubt, but I'm very suspicious of the underlying motivations of Palestinian advocates. Again, the sub-text of a lot of their arguments is that the Palestinians have the RIGHT to attack Israel--indefinitely--but Israel doesn't have the right to try to wipe them out to preserve Israeli life. If think a lot of the anger at Israel is a direct product of the fact that Israel has violated the ""unspoken rule"" of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which is a sort of ""you kill some, and then we kill some"" dance, where the conflict just goes on endlessly -- but in a low-level way that doesn't cause international upset. In other words, that kind of low-level, ""balanced"" conflict allows the international community to go back to pretending the problem doesn't exist. But Oct. 7 was too big, and Israel basically said, ""screw this, we're finishing this permanently,"" and that's what the international community doesn't like. They're forced to notice Israel's dilemma, and they don't like that. They think Israel is getting uppity and breaking the rules.

Regarding tactics, not strategy, if you're suggesting that Israel should AIM BETTER so that it kills fewer civilians as it attacks Hamas, that may -- or may not -- be good advice. I simply don't know enough about how Israel chooses its targets, and to what degree those targets are guilty people. But then, I doubt you know either. You're just guessing. If you actually know a way to eliminate Hamas more easily, you should definitely share that information with your local Israeli consulate or embassy.

&gt;AnÂ ethnocracyÂ is a type of political structure in which theÂ stateÂ apparatus is controlled by a dominantÂ ethnic groupÂ (or groups) to further its interests, power, dominance, and resources. Ethnocratic regimes in the modern era typically display a 'thin' democratic faÃ§ade covering a more profound ethnic structure, in which ethnicity (race, religion, language etc) â and not citizenship â is the key to securing power and resources.[1]

&gt;An ethnocratic society facilitates the ethnicization of the state by the dominant group, through the expansion of control likely accompanied by conflict with minorities or neighbouring states. A theory of ethnocratic regimes was developed byÂ critical geographerÂ Oren YiftachelÂ during the 1990s and later developedÂ ",5/26/2024 21:31,Pro-Palestine

4. Anti Zionism is antisemitism because it is based on fake news( aka blood tales) and call for the death of Jews or forced immigration which is very similar to the ideas of nazi Germany.

5. Well I don't see any other ICC case on genocide against any other state including those who actually commit genocide like Syria.

There are 7 million today in Israel, west bank and Gaza. Actually Israel can't agree for the right of return cause then Israel won't be a Jewish state anymore. 


11. If Israel had actually delt with Hamas previously everything would have been better. Most Israelis actually wanted far more robust operation than the current with no humanitarian aid. The fact that Israel gives humanitarian aid is the reason this war doesn't end. Cause Hamas doesn't have any reason to stop.

906,"You forgot like half of the ME.

For example Syria just had a bloody civil war with 300K+ civilian intentional civilian deaths.

Sudan and Yemen has millions of kids starving, many are dying. Wars across Africa are ignored and no one sends them help.

The Palestinians got a shit ton of aid - almost 1 kg of food for every Palestinian on average for every day in the war, just from the aid (spoiler for the ones claiming it's not enough - that's not including the usual food that is entered for selling by merchants).

There is no starvation in Gaza, at least not one that is ""intentional by the Zionist regime"", because the food is there. But there are African countries that are suffering from wars...where's the spotlight there?

And that's without bringing up food prices which is what every Israel-hater and the ICC intentionally ignores - prices of products are changing because of demand and supply. Since Israel got hold of Rafah entrance, food prices have **significantly** dropped in Gaza.

4 days ago a post by a Gazan said, while attacking Hamas, that before Israel got control - 1 egg was ~1.5$, a kg of sugar was ~23$ and a small bag of coffee was ~1.3$ (changing here from Shekels to dollars). And now that the ""bad guys"" are controlling it for just a short time, prices has dropped to 10 eggs cost ~2.5$, a kg of sugar costs 1.5$ and 10 small bags of coffee cost ~2.5$ and prices are continuing to drop.

That's definitely not the only post about it there is.

I would've shown the image, if Telegram wasn't hard blacklisted from reddit for some reason, apparently.

Idk about you - but if prices are dropping this fast, it can't be that there is a huge supply issue of food in Gaza, in my opinion. It could be that there should be more - that's debateable. But claiming that it's a huge crisis like many are trying to paint it? Out of the question.

The opposite is true. The majority are ""radical"" but that is a western misunderstanding and misapplication of the term.

A big problem is that I think people from the global north â â and I am not one of those â â still retain this instinctive western bias that all people are liberal rationalists. So, for example, they will by default just assume that the ""radicals"" in any given population, like Gaza or Muslims in New York, MUST be in the minority. But is there actually any evidence of that?

Where exactly are the Gazan people who did not commit rape/murder AND did not condone rape/murder?

Let's just take the rape question.

Online you can find the videos that the Hamas terrorists posted of themselves, returning to Gaza, with naked, beaten, and likely raped women...who had just been murdered or might just about to be murdered.

Here is one. A Jewish woman is cowering, obviously, raped, about to be killed in her last moments, she is hearing people jeering at her torn, naked flesh.

https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/s/x76uj6FeQr

In the other videos you can see the people of Gaza cheering, laughing, taunting, just having a really wonderful happy moment. 

MORE important you do NOT see anyone speaking up.

You do not see any religious leaders, business leaders, humanitarian leaders, anyone at all speaking up and saying ""wait, stop, this is not our cause"" or ""not in our name!""

Do you honestly think that that could happen publicly anywhere else in the world and NOBODY speak up? 

You have to stop this ridiculous line of distinguishing between the ordinary Palestinians (adults) and Hamas.

As I said it's racist to say ""Hamas does not represent the ordinary Gazan."" What you are saying is that ""I, as a white Westerner, think this way, and so all people in the world must think as I do.""

By the way, I am not a white westerner and I can tell you not everybody in the world thinks exactly like white Westerners.

No, different people in different parts of the world may hold completely different values for political, religious, cultural, or many other reasons.

It feels odd that I have to spell this out but obviously it is a widespread assumption, especially in the left-wing intellectual circles in the west, that all people are moderate in the majority and radicals are only in the minority.

Yet...we have no evidence that, for example, anyone in Gaza opposed rape of Jewish women.

I'm glad to hear that the kings of Oman or Bahrain or a Saudi Minister opposed it -- weeks later.

But apparently nobody in Gaza opposed it, and from what we're seeing on the streets of London and Toronto, millions of white leftists and Palestinians/Arabs are perfectly fine with the mass rape of women.

Most recently we learned:

-Hostages have been farmed out to elements within the Gaza population

-One of the hostages escaped, and then was captured by ordinary Gaza citizens, and returned to the terrorists.

-Gazans stoning hostage RC bus... a blatant violation of every rule of hostage release done spontaneously by the ""people of Gaza""

https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8PUrVLt/

-it is now coming out how the hostages were treated terribly, not just by their ""captors,"" but everyone they came into contact with as in ""let's turn the Jew into a sex slave.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/s/WdABtquDdP

-we even know now that some of the hostages were kept with UN employees--so even the UN employee Gazans were pro Hamas

Finally, we have very simple public opinion poll data. I mean I assume it must be very difficult to actually do these polls, but they always show overwhelming support for terrorism and they certainly show right now on the West Bank and Gaza overwhelming support for October 7.

Again, prove this wrong without resorting to waving hands in the air and stating a variation of ""all the people of Gaza are just like me.""

""You are being racist."" You say? ""You are trying to say that the Gazans are monsters.""

No, it is the western leftists and pseudo-intellectuals and useful idiots who are saying that the Gazans cannot hold an opinion that you don't approve of.

What evidence do you have?

Again you're going to that same, 'accidents happen narrative' - I assume your counter is to ask me to name more examples of IDF's war crimes.

There's no way you genuinely believe IDF were involved in a few horrible accidents which resulted in deaths of Palestinian civilians. Mistakes happen once or twice, not over and over again. 

And again, this is the hypocrisy I mean. When IDF commits war crimes, you still support them and say ""It's not perfect and there are horrible things done"" but when Hamas does it, your reaction is ""Hamas are pure evil"" which they are, no one's disagreeing with you on that, I'm just asking for a fair view on this situation which people on both sides just simply refuse to have at all.

Shocker.
How about you drop the act and tell us all who is more extreame? The settlers attempt to stop aid from flowing via Israel to Gaza,
Or Hamas, who controls Gaza.

Surely, these settlers pillaging food aid are worse than a terror group who committed countless suicide bombings, attacks, massacres, all while celebrating the suicidal martyrs by handing out candy to their pepole to celebrate successful suicide attacks.

The entire western world, and most of a lit of the non western one calls Hamas a terror group



2. Israel alleged 30 unrwa workers participated,
But that's just the tip of the iceberg,
Again, there were Hamas MainFrames with lots of servers directly under UNRWA HQ in Gaza,
All the power was siphoned from within the HQ,

But no one saw anything, and no one heard anything.

Surely, since it has the letters UN in UNRWA then it must be rightous org, right ?
God forbid they'll support terror.
After all, they're aid workers, the whole hostage taking and murder is a fluke, only 30 of them did it, but if they die , Surely they died as aid workers, so that number can be used against Israel.

1) Gazans don't need any aid but food aid

2) The UN has been disingenuous in anyway about their statements

Let's reread OP's linked UN statement.

&gt; I want to give you a humanitarian update on Gaza.  The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports that â over four consecutive days, from Saturday through Tuesday â 62 trucks travelled through the Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza, carrying water, food and medical supplies.  Most of this aid has already reached hospitals, ambulances, and internally displaced persons (IDPs).  However, the daily average of trucks allowed into Gaza prior to the hostilities was about 500.

Nowhere is it stated that 500 trucks were exclusively food aid. 

&gt; I think you are being disingenuous or you're incredibly stupid because arguing Gaza also might need construction supplies they can't use now has nothing to do with how much food they are getting vs. how much they used to get. 

So prior to 10/7, Gaza was getting ~90 food trucks a day by OP's math. Now, they are getting 62 TOTAL trucks a day. So no, this isn't really up for debate that they are getting less food now. This entire thread is based on a false premise.",5/24/2024 21:17,Neutral
925,"&gt;They hit north south east and west there is no safe area in gaza now

This is Hamas talking point. And it is easily disproven - open a map of all airstrikes and you'll see that almost nothing is being dropped on the south and almost everything is in the north. Hamas wants to convince the local population that ""nowhere is safe"" thus it's futile to move and they can continue to use them as human shields.

&gt;The IDF strikes rafah and strikes the ""Safe route""

Again, these strikes were from Hamas, actually they weren't even airstrikes, they were found to be land based IEDs. Hamas doesn't want Palestinian people to leave and to be safe, they want them dead so they can become martyrs and a source of PR outrage for other militant groups.

&gt;Why israel is hitting hospitals

Al-Shifa is located on the shore, where the encirclement of Gaza city must connect, so far there's 3 km gap. Also they have solid intel that Hamas uses the tunnels underground - but this is pretty much all of Gaza. Unfortunately any civilian infrastructure used (even partially) for military purposes automatically becomes a military infrastructure.

&gt;What is happening is a genocide and killing civilians and innocents

I haven't seen any proof of that, every war has civilian casualties, so far from the numbers we can tell that there's about 1 civilian casualty per 2 bombs dropped, it's unfortunate but to me this is pretty obvious that IDF is trying to minimize the number of civilian casualties, which is the opposite of a genocide.

Anyone in their right mind would resist them.

They are largely the most depraved thing to has happened to this world since 1939-1944 if you believe those numbers. I say that because every western article says 1,200 Israelis and any other deaths are by Hamas lead health ministers, it is two terrorist ideologies at war here . Judaism says followers should not ever create their own nation, of course Jesus said act in peace but that didnât stop the Catholics from waging 1000+ of year on anyone who did not agree with them.. to clarify Isreal created Hamas, then funded it. This was premeditated and organized as any quick search will show you. Let us not forget Isreali had a convicted terrorist as its president in the 60âs killed US marines in the 70âs. Or is tiny welfare nation that relies on Christian guilt from World War Two for itâs survival. It is all a crock of horseshit and they have most assuredly triggered a nuclear arms rush.

""would also be conditioned on the Palestinian Authority undertaking reforms to make it a governing body that Palestinians trust and see as legitimate and Israelis see as effective.""

So even without details about what this pathway entails, it looks like they aren't completely ignorant of things, as they welcome the undertaking of reforms and things... I'm pretty sure that negotiations would be part of the finalized deal, even according to the Saudis. 

All of what you're saying about the ability is pretty true, although I guess that in the final deal there would be sanctions in cases when the new Palestinian state imports weapons, and perhaps some watchdogs or something, though it's indeed not foolproof. However, you seem to think that Iran can't send weapons to it's proxies right now. what prevents them from sending nuclear missiles or advanced weapons to Hezbollah? Israel can't conquer everyone who's against it, or everyone who Iran influences.   
Short thing is that the only way Israel would ever be truly safe is if the surrounding Arab states would accept it - and there are much higher chances of that happening when there's a Palestinian state, even if not in all of the land that they think, and with the largest Arab and Muslim countries having relations with Israel. Part of what's causing Arab countries to hate Jews and Israelis so much is the insane amount of ragebaits that I'm sure they see of Palestinians suffering.. and this is bound to happen so long as Israel controls Palestinian areas, no matter how much the IDF tries to remain moral. I'm sure that these would exist after as well, but they would have a much lesser effect.

And yes, I think that the martyr fund is horrible, and I think that the Palestinian education system is horrible - and as part of the reforms in the path for peace - both of those things would have to go. it just seems like Israel expects them to go without a promise to the Palestinians - and why would the Palestinians do that? I mean, ideally the world would pressure them on doing that, but I don't think that's very likely.. 

I agree that this path should start with Hamas removed from power or at least renounces terrorism, as otherwise all of the reforms would simply fail - however, I don't know what power does Hamas have right now. I mean they had like 4 battalions in Rafah IIRC and some fraction of forces in other places before the Rafah operation, and I guess by now it's less than that..  A new gov with the support of some military force, whether it's Arab or Israeli, could be in power at the moment and win over Hamas. Right now the problem IMO is not how strong Hamas is militarily, but how strong is the ""terrorism ideology"", meaning that no matter who rules Gaza the ""day after"", they would have a lot of challenges on their hands.    
I don't care so much about Israel ending the war earlier or later (as long as they remain pretty legit with their use of force and the casualties don't continue to go up drastically), as much as I care about Israel not missing the train on influencing how the peace process is going to look like and the entire thing ending up unstable.",5/23/2024 17:00,Neutral

949,"One should always be careful about plain numbers as they can be used to ""prove"" all sort of things unless you know the context in detail.  The UN says there used to be on average 500 trucks per day allowed in, now it is about 100.

Israel may well be right that they are allowing the same or even more than before in terms of food trucks but perhaps the other trucks that used to carry things that allowed to make use of that food such as fuel etc. are not being allowed. If you give me a truck full of flour and the bakery is destroyed or, even if it were open, there is no fuel to operate it, not much use, or? That is, assuming I have enough clean water to make dough etc. and clean useable water is very rare in Gaza.

It may also be that due to the war and with the entire Gaza utterly devastated, with bakeries targeted and destroyed, with no shops to buy food etc., meaning everyone in Gaza is reliant on aid only, that the demand for aid now is astronomically higher. In any case, all humanitarian organisations are saying they are dealing with a huge humanitarian crisis with the risk of famine. You can't possibly say they are all lying and Israel alone is right.

It appears to me that there is abundant evidence that Israel is deliberately hampering aid delivery. Just a few days, a delegation of US senators  visited Rafah crossing. US senators are the last people you can accused of being anti-Israel. Here, I quote from the article:

""Trucks  carrying aid cargos can wait for weeks at the border for their  turn to  be processed, they said they were told by aid officials. They  enter  the Egyptian side of the border, drive along no-manâs land to the   Israeli facility at Nitzana for inspection by the military, then return   to Rafah to cross into Gaza â or go to Kerem Shalom for inspection and   entry there.

Kerem Shalom  operates eight hours a day, and both it  and Nitzana close part of  Friday and all Saturday. âThis, in a 24-hour-a  dayâ humanitarian  crisis, Van Hollen said.

Israel says the inspections are necessary to prevent items of military use from reaching Hamas.

**During   the process, cargos are unloaded and reloaded several times. If   inspectors reject a single item in a truck, it must return with its   entire cargo to be re-packaged, starting the weeks-long process all over   again**, said Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland.

The reasons for rejection are often â**very vague, and they are  conveyed informally. Sometimes they were very unreasonable**,â said  Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon.

The  two senators said they saw a  warehouse in Rafah filled with material  that had been rejected in  inspection. It included oxygen cylinders,  gas-powered generators, tents  and **medical kits used in delivering  babies**.

Aid workers told the   senators the tents were refused because they included metal poles, and   the medical kits because they included scalpels. Most solar-powered   equipment appears to be barred â though it is vital in Gaza, where   central electricity has collapsed and fuel for generators is in short   supply.

âThe warehouse was a testament to the arbitrarinessâ of the process, Van Hollen said.

There   is a process for pre-approving cargos, but it can take weeks, they   said, and even items that obtained prior approval are sometimes rejected   during inspection. After inspection, trucks are considered âsanitizedâ   and their drivers are not allowed to interact with anyone; the  senators  said they were told one truck driver was turned back after  someone  brought him a cup of coffee, violating the rule.""

No need to argue that, as that's neither here nor there. If someone presents reasons as to why they believe they're not currently committing war crimes, I'll concede. 


The reason I bring this up here, though, is because one big pro-Israeli argument as to why Israel is NOT committing genocide is because they are so compassionate and are  taking so much care to not kill civilians. They claim that the conservative ~25k dead civilians are merely casualties of war. While a program like Where's Daddy alludes to it, I do not believe that they are necessarily targeting civilians. I do, however, believe that they do not care whether or not they kill Palestinian civilians.

You cite a source that says that most armed conflicts result in a civilian casualty rate between 60-70% percent. I went to the page you sourced, and must ask -  you how did you get this?

Below is the graphic of selected wars since 1950:



Of the 11 conflicts listed, only 3 of them reach 60%:

Korean War (74%) - God awful statistic. Don't know what happened there enough to try to read into the high casualty rate. I don't believe I've ever heard this conflict labeled as a genocide, though
Persian Gulf War (87%) - Can reasonably be called a genocide
Iraq War(66%) - Despite being an American myself, I feel can reasonably be called a genocide
And to prove a point, I'll also throw in the only 2 other conflicts that were above 50%:

Balkans War (52%) - Universally accepted as a genocide
2nd Intifada (51%) - 719 Israeli civilians were killed. 2,204 Palestinian civilians were killed.
I do not use these numbers to definitively prove that Israel is, indeed, committing genocide. Rather, I am hoping that this helps to demonstrate that Israel is not ""behaving better than any other country would"", as the pro-Israeli argument so often puts forth. 

You cite a casualty rate of 64%, which is more than double the rate of the Syrian Civil War (28%). This is a war that rightfully caused the world to justly view Assad as a war criminal. I believe that Israel's/Netanyahu's actions qualify it/him of as much also.

I am also responding to you because I believe that the people who try to use these ratios are either disingenuous or ill informed. 



I am also responding to you because I believe that the people who try to use these ratios are either disingenuous or ill informed. 

I know that you haven't, so I apologize in advance for arguing against a point that you're not making, but I have heard the pro-Israeli argument cite the UN's reported 90% casualty rate in wars. 

I've actually looked into this and have gathered that this is only true if you accept a wider definition of ""civilian casualties"" than what we are using for this conflict. For example, please see these statistics regarding the Ukrainian War:

""Since 24Â February, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded 8,089 civilian casualties in Ukraine, with 3,811 killed...""



You can see that the death rate is lower than and separate from the ""casualty"" rate. The UN is clearly not equating the two. If we use that definition of civilian casualties and include all of those who've been injured and/or displaced in Gaza, the casualty rate would be insanely high now that we know 1.5 million people are currently seeking refuge in Rafah.

Again, I know that you're not making this argument - indeed, you cited a study with completely different figures, but I just bring that up as an example of people excusing Israel's transgressions by pointing to other conflicts where, even then, Israel's numbers are still pretty bad.

In summary, I am not saying that Israel is absolutely 100% committing genocide, but I am saying that even if one doesn't believe that it's a genocide, they can/should still acknowledge that Israel is not taking much care to protect innocent civilians in their pursuit to  go after Hamas (which they rightfully should do).

...or NOT care that Israel isn't doing that and just admit that they believe that the ends justify the means, regardless of the amount of innocent people that die.

But to look at all of the footage and numbers and think that Israel is conducting this war in a humane(to solely the civilians) manner seems, again, disingenuous.",5/20/2024 19:22,Pro-Palestine

He has Palestinian ties. It's in his name dude. And his claims does not make anything true. Unless you can back anything up with investigation with verified documents everything he says could be fairy tale.

The fact that he's has a Palestinian connection and he's been outspoken about Palestinian issue for so long makes him susceptible to spread exactly the kind of FUD he does

&gt;He has many points on the human shields argument. If you watched the video carefully.

Did you read what I said?? Why are hamas terrorists during an active war being surrounded by family members and innocents. Why are their HQs in hospitals? Why didn't they make an evacuation plan where innocents would maybe go south and Hamas and IDF fights in the north, like literally what any other country would do. Hamas used Al Shifa as their terror hq. These are all well proven facts unlike heresay you present from a random YouTube reporting a Palestinian sympathiser.

&gt;safe zones, which were designated as safe areas by the IDF

IDF says otherwise and any safe zones that would later be used a source of violence would immediately make it a military target. Like Al Shifa hospital.

So if IDF says something else and you say something else, it needs to be investigated. You can't treat it like it's some fact without overwhelming evidence of the same. 

&gt;Does that mean israel should bomb Palestinians in gaza when getting aid?

The aid truck example in the video is when Palestinians stormed onto the truck. That's risky and obviously they would try to defend themselves because there could be a suicide bomber (the Hamas MO)

They only learn the truth when they go out into the world, interact with other races &amp; r quite angry learning how much they were lied to. This was my experience as well with the Jewish family I lived with &amp; all of my Jewish friends. Many of the protesters u see being antisemitic r actually undercover Israel supporters trying to make protesters look hateful. Zionist orgs r offering Israel supporters money to do this and they r. Thankfully they r getting caught. Young American Jews r turning on Israel in record numbers &amp; this started way before the 7th. Being taught ur whole life that Israel was created peacefully on empty land except for a few Arabs who mistreated the land. A land without a ppl for a ppl without a land. Itâs nonsense! Spend yrs learning all about Israel but never being told of the existence of the Palestinian ppl. I thought it was all Palestinians &amp; Israel was trying to live in peace. That was bs. I didnât know anything about Zionist terrorists who were more brutal than Hamas. I didnât know Israelis absolutely teach their children to hate &amp; have hateful tv shows. Teachers &amp; rabbis teaching kids hate &amp; racism. Seeing Jesus &amp; Mary mocked on Israeli tv made me sick.

Now imagine ur elderly parents now having to climb a ladder into the second story back window anytime they need to enter or exit their home that they paid for. Or segregated busses. The WB is like the Jim Crow south. Having to cover the streets where ppl of ur race live in nets to catch all the things/garbage/giant rocks (even fire bombs) ur neighbors constantly throw at ur &amp; ur children as they just try to be kids &amp; play outside. Or knowing the settlers or army can murder u, arrest u without cause &amp; with impunity. Is it normal for police to arrest a 7 yr old without charge or cause &amp; throw them into prison for yrs without ever letting ur see them. Or only trying Palestinians in military courts. Stealing ur dead loved oneâs body to harvest/steal their skin &amp; organs against ur will. I didnât know about the insane amount of violent religious extremists that target everyone who isnât Jewish including Christians &amp; Catholics of all ethnicities.

Begging for help because u r terrified to leave ur home or go to church &amp; being ignored by the government &amp; having police laugh at u &amp; say our job is to protect Jews only. A tv crew went to Jerusalem to see how bad it really was. An journalist undercover dressed as a priest to see what would happen. Within minutes he was attacked &amp; spit on multiple times, including by children as their parents encourage it. Didnât know there were settler terrorist groups like the Hilltop youth who burn babies alive &amp; spend their days overjoyed as they terrorize Palestinians &amp; no one cares. Right in front of the army/idf &amp; most of the time the army joins in. So brazen in their impunity, armed settlers invited a cnn film crew to film them as they stormed an elderly couples home, beat them, robbed them &amp; expelled them from their home as the IDF watched. Their only action was to threaten the film crew. Why are u continuously conflating all Palestinians with Hamas? Not all Palestinians r Hamas donât kill ppl of different ethnicities, including Jews or want to. Jewish kids have gone to the Palestinian territory to see the reality &amp; have been welcomed. Outsiders/college kids have gone there to protest &amp; were killed but by Israel.

They allow Israeli officials to blatantly lie in interviews. There is a reason they donât allow any journalists in &amp; target/kill Palestinian journalists in record numbers. They have much to hide. Anyone just getting their info through media is usually bias. They r not given the truth. CNN has to run all stories by Israel to be approved. Before air.

Israel is an expert in Hasbara/propaganda &amp; u too have bought it. Clearly! Peace deal? Where is ur knowledge from on this subject? Clearly not from the facts. Itâs the western media pushing Israelâs narrative that peace was offered but denied cuz Palestinians only want to kill Jews. Itâs ridiculous! Hereâs their âgenerousâ deal for u, if u accept itâs concrete &amp; this is how itâll be forever. weâll allow u to call urself a state but u will not have any rights of a state. No control over airspace, borders, aid, water or ports. Uâll get this % of the West Bank but not the West Bank as it is on the map but we what we consider the West Bank, meaning we r taking a lot more land. Also we will take 20% of ur most fertile lands &amp; give u 5% of desert wasteland, trash dump. Israel took control of the water so Israeli only need to turn the tap yet Palestinians r lucky if their was is on a few times a month. Plenty of water just not for u.The army will have the right to enter ur âstateâ anytime there is an emergency but u r not allowed to know what constitutes an emergency &amp; u canât ever enter into diplomatic relations with any other country without our approval &amp; permission. Just a few examples of the details of their bs deal. That would leave Palestinians worse off than they were &amp; it would be set in stone. No one in their right mind would take that. 10/7 will never be forgotten &amp; understandably yet when Zionist terrorists committed worse massacres on Palestinians, we never hear about it or the children &amp; old ppl they targeted. We donât hear about the great March of return where Palestinians protested peacefully (including westerners) for months. Or how that was met with sniper bullets. 
People on both sides r not dying. Sadly Israelis died on 10/7 but the daily slaughter for months is on Palestinians only.

Unlike Ukraine where most women and children were sent out of the country to wait out the war, unfortunately the people of Gaza have not been offered similar accommodation by neighboring countries.

994,"&gt;Actually, the reason why the zionists âwonâ during the mass ethnic cleaning of the Nakba is because the British were heavily arming the zionists and taking away any and all weapons found on the Palestinian People.

Nope, literally the exact opposite was true in the 1940s. Also, war crimes aside, the 1948 war was still an actual war. Nearly 6,000 Israelis were killed in the fighting, with another 900 killed during the civil war for the Mandate. The 1948 war was indeed the Israeli âwar of independenceâ. They were fighting for the right to keep oppressing Palestinians.

The British, having switched sides under the White Paper, fought a two year-long war against Zionist terrorists to prevent the establishment of Israel between 1945 and 1947. They confiscated numerous weapon caches and interned tens of thousands of illegal Jewish immigrants. The Arabs only stood a chance in the 1948 war since the British intentionally weakening Israel and strengthening the Palestinians and the Arab states. During the 1948 war, they continued to hold about 11,000 illegal Jewish immigrants, mainly military-age males, in their internment camps. Authorities in the British and American occupation zones of Germany and Austria imposed restrictions on the emigration of males of military age to Israel during the war. Rather than disarming the Palestinians, they disarmed the Zionists. At times, they even handed the disarmed Zionists over to the Palestinians to face the people's judgement.

&gt;On 12 February 1948, four Haganah men were arrested by an army patrol and released into the Muslim quarter of the old city of Jerusalem, only to be found beaten to death three hours later. A similar incident occurred a fortnight later, on 28 February, when British troops disarmed Haganah men at a position in the Hayotzek Factory near Holon.

1006,"&gt; Why would israel kill its own hostages?

Do you think that high explosive bombs and missiles have some sort of magical ability to kill Palestinians while leaving Israelis in the same room alive?

Israeli soldiers and police are trigger-happy and careless:

* When two Hamas terrorists shot up a bus stop in Jerusalem, killing and injuring 19 people, Yuval Castleman (an Israeli) rushed the terrorists and shot at them. He was then shot and wounded by an IDF soldier. He fell to his knees, threw his gun down, put his hands in the air, and called out in Hebrew ""Don't shoot I'm Jewish"" and [the soldier executed him in cold blood](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/family-of-civilian-shot-dead-by-soldiers-during-jerusalem-attack-says-he-was-executed/).

* Three hostages, Yotam Haim, Samer Talalka and Alon Shamriz, managed to escape from their captives. They stripped to their underwear to prove they were not armed, and came out of hiding to call an IDF patrol for help, waving white flags. The patrol shot and killed two of them. The survivor was wounded, and retreated back into the building. He called out in Hebrew, the patrol stopped firing, and when he stepped out again still holding a white flag, the IDF soldiers [shot him dead too](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67738111).

* Another prisoner, Ron Sherman, was killed (together with two other hostages) during an IDF attack on a Hamas tunnel. No cause of death has been reported, and his mother has accused the IDF of [using poison gas on the tunnel](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-782544), which Israel has neither confirmed or denied. They promised to do further tests but as far as I can see six months later there is still no cause of death given for Sherman or the other two hostages, dead apparently with no sign of any life-threatening injury. Rumours early in the war was that the IDF was going to flood the tunnels with poison gas, so who knows?

For many years, it was **official** IDF policy to deny Hamas hostages [by any means possible, the Hannibal Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Directive). Obviously this was not popular among the rank and file, and ""officially"" it was cancelled in 2016. And then October 7 happened.

* The Guardian published a story showing [photos of houses clearly blown up by high explosives](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/11/it-was-a-pogrom-beeri-survivors-horrific-attack-hamas-terrorists), and even stated that they were blown up by Israeli forces: âBuilding after building has been destroyed ... Israeli tanks blasted the Hamas militants where they were hiding. Floors collapsed on floors. Roof beams were tangled and exposed like rib cages.â Somehow they failed to mention that there were Israeli civilian captives *right there in the same rooms* that were blown up.

* The Times Of Israel also reported the same thing, and [talked about blasted out concrete and rebar](https://www.timesofisrael.com/amid-the-devastation-of-kibbutz-beeri-israel-keeps-pulling-bodies-from-the-rubble/). The Hamas fighters were armed with small arms and RPGs, there is no possible way for them to do all the damage shown in those reports. Like the Guardian, they neglected to mention that the hostages were right there in the same houses being shelled by the Israeli tanks.

* The security coordinator at Kibbutz Beâeri, Tuval Escapa, [stated that the Israeli forces shelled houses on their occupants in order to eliminate the terrorists along with the hostages](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231030-report-7-october-testimonies-strikes-major-blow-to-israeli-narrative/).

* Later reports from [survivors like Israeli woman Yasmin Porat](https://electronicintifada.net/content/israeli-forces-shot-their-own-civilians-kibbutz-survivor-says/38861) made it clear that many of the hostages had been killed by Israeli forces. She described [Israeli special forces killing Hamas fighters and hostages alike](https://www.trtworld.com/middle-east/hannibal-directive-did-israel-kill-its-own-15574953).

* At the music festival, Israeli civilians [were shelled by Israeli forces](https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2023-10-23/israel-kill-hamas-hostages/) to deny their use as captives, and then the incinerated corpses blamed on Hamas. Israeli spokesman Mark Regev admitted that many of the bodies at the music festival were so badly burned that [they initially mistook 200 Hamas fighters for festival goers](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/israel-admits-burning-hundreds-people-7-october).

* Hundreds of cars were destroyed from above, the roofs collapsed down showing that the explosion came from the sky. Hamas has no airforce. Israel attack helicopters fired on [everything moving](https://braveneweurope.com/max-blumenthal-what-really-happened-in-israel-on-oct-7), whether they were Israeli captives or Hamas, to [stop the militants reaching Gaza with any living hostages](https://thegrayzone.com/2023/10/27/israels-military-shelled-burning-tanks-helicopters/).

* France24 [tried to ""debunk"" these revelations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57UQKWdZRco), during which they admitted that the Israeli attack helicopter pilots couldn't distinguish Hamas fighters from civilians. So they want us to believe that even though the pilots couldn't tell fighters from captives, *somehow* by some miracle of magic, they only killed the fighters.

* Brigadier General Avi Rosenfeld called in [an air strike on his own position to repulse the Hamas fighters](https://mondoweiss.net/2023/10/a-growing-number-of-reports-indicate-israeli-forces-responsible-for-israeli-civilian-and-military-deaths-following-october-7-attack/), killing some of his own forces.",5/12/2024 21:07,Pro-Palestine

He was, privately, a supporter of the Irgun and its front organization, the American League for a Free Palestine. Baruch implied that a French failure to support the resolution might block planned American aid to France, which was badly needed for reconstruction, French currency reserves being exhausted and its balance of payments heavily in deficit. Previously, to avoid antagonising its Arab colonies, France had not publicly supported the resolution. After considering the danger of American aid being withheld, France finally voted in favour of it. So, too, did France's neighbours, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.

You have to understand peace won't come while the violent foreign zionist terrorist entity thinks it can dictate terms with no concern whatsoever for the position of the 14 million native Palestinians.

Ultimatums where violent european terrorists take Palestines capital and ""offer"" barren worthless desert in ""exchange"" isn't the formula for peace no matter how much violent european terrorists want it to be.

It's only when the violent european terrorist entity accepts that the needs of the 14 million native Palestinians are as, or more important than their needs are, for things like land, security, water, stability and so on, that peace can happen.

And making impossible demands is of course also self defeating, pointless, and stupid.

It's part of the same problem.

Native Palestinians need a viable homeland for a population of 14 million rapidly growing people.

I don't think zionists will ever be able to look beyond their insane death cult crusade to understand that.

It means the violent foreign zionist terrorists would steal 66% of Palestine from the native Palestinians and the native Palestinians would live in three separate areas cut into swiss cheese.

Vehicles were burnt by hamas terrorist actions (actions like shooting RPG's/using IED's on the vehicles of both Nova festival goers and surrounding towns/villages, blowing up gas tanks, setting fire to homes using lighters), often with wounded/bodies inside.

I've seen photographic and video evidence produced by Zaka (Israeli religious volunteer organization which collects remains of the dead) and hamas themselves which can make your skin crawl due to the nature of human kind.

Also if you read around a bit (known used shell/bomb/missile types) , you'll see Israel invests very much into the precision of both its airforce and artillery core. 

Please, I would like you to find the IDF quote of your claim. 200 bodies were misidentified, but AFAIK it was due to decomposition from natural causes.


You know, By your logic, Hamas ""arrested"" a 11 month (year now) old baby called Kfir Bibas, together with 252 known other people, some of which are old enough to have lived through the holocaust 

Using only your logic to attempt an answer - Israel by comparison has never ""detained"" someone who's too young or infirm to hold a gun or a knife/pose some other real security risk


If i attempt to answer factually, then most arrested palestinians are held until their background check is passed (ignoring recent polls from all palestinian territories which show overwhelming support for the actions of hamas on october 7th, which IMO is borderline suicidal). If it doesn't pass though, they are held in whats called ""Administrative Detention"" - which although i once thought was controversial, now i think is absolutely necessary. It is represented and limited (within reason) in [Israeli law](https://www.nevo.co.il/law_html/law01/319_106.htm) (the site is in hebrew but you can run it through a translator), and unlike our kidnapped citizens and IDF personnel they get access to operation level medical care (Yahya Sinwar is actually alive today only because he had a brain tumor removed by an Israeli surgeon while imprisoned in 2008), can enroll in university and attain higher education, and get monitored communication with the outside world. 

And also factually, some identified remains of people were later reclassed as belonging to kidnapped people due to the nature of those remains (the other way around too), so the numbers kept updating for the first two months or so of the war. 

You know, i once shared your sentiment, but now i don't want anything to do with them. I say, let them have a state. They are in love with death, and with us out of the question, they'll eat each other until nothing remains but dust",5/9/2024 15:45,Pro-Israel
1040,"&gt; No, that is not what occupation means. Occupation means that a hostile military has administrative control over the political affairs of a nation. Israel had no control over Gaza's internal operations, ergo it was not an occupation. 

International law disagrees.

So does the UN.

So does the majority of countries.

Also the majority of Human Rights organizations

So does common sense.

But if you are so obsess with administrative control, then explain away Israel controlling everything that enters or leaves legally. That sounds like a degree of administrative control as Gazans have to fill out Israeli paperwork.

BTW, don't forget, 25% of all Palestinians who grew up during the blockade are a full 2 inches shorter from the starvation Israel inflicted on Gaza.

&gt; Wrong, the Philadelphi Accord turned over complete border control to Egypt. Palestinians in 2008 breached the border, setting off an explosion, and half of 1.5 million crossed the border into Egypt illegally. They closed the border initially in 2007 before Hamas took control of Gaza because Hamas had just defeated Fatah in a coup.  
&gt;  
&gt;On 17 Jan 2008 after militants fired rockets on Israel, Mubarak actually *didn't* close the border at first due to the humanitarian crisis. Then on 27 Jan Olmert and al-Zahar agreed that Abbas and Egypt would control Rafah. Due to that breach, they continued the blockade, because the people at the border are too militarized.  
&gt;  
&gt;You own a computer, you can look this stuff up for yourself.

An elaborate justification to ignore the fact Israel wants the border closed and Egypt obliges because it doesn't want to piss off the US by pissing off Israel. You can scream about Nubarak all you want, he didn't rule that long. My point stands.  The border is closed because Israel wants it that way.

&gt;In every peace offer Israel has maintained that they are free to close their borders to Palestinians, which they are. This is not an occupation.  

And they also demand the right to close all of Palestine's borders, including its airspace and sea space. That's right, in every agreement, Israel reserves the right to control everything coming in or leaving by land, air, and sea. It further demands the right to send any of its military through Palestinian land, airspace and sea space for any reason at any time.",5/9/2024 15:44,Pro-Palestine

Do you understand why I compared it to the Roman occupation?

Though, to be fair, the israelites invaded and conquered Canaan.  So the Roman conquest was one conqueror conquering another conqueror.

Let's say, for instance, that the iranian response to zionist terrorists blowing up an iranian consulate.

Say that had killed 35,000 Jewish israelis.

You confronted someone supporting iran, and they compare it to something like the death of 5 Iranians, killed by zionists.  They compare it to a family of lebanese civilians slaughtered by zionists...

For the IDF having enough reservists point, the point is IDF does not want to have to deal with something like Oct 7 ever again. Why would they wait for Hamas to do this again and then crush them then. Why not now? Moreover, the 300k reservists are not just people sitting around on their couches in Israel. They are people with regular jobs, contributing to their economy and living life like a normal civilian, teaching at schools, working in tech companies etc etc. I don't quite understand how the 300k reservists combats the 6k prisoner issue. Are you saying the numbers of IDF reservists is 50x more than the prisoners so they should be able to handle the extra Hamas terrorists? So every time they attack, Israel should ask these normal people to stop their lives, stop working and then attack Hamas. It comes at a huge economic cost to Israel - why would they do that?

War isn't neat and tidy. People fight wars, and people make mistakes, so in war mistakes are made by people. Make sense?

I agree that Israel needs to loosen restrictions on inspections for trucks entering Gaza, because in my opinion, they have been successful in dismantling a lot of Hamas leadership and infrastructure.

The end phase of this conflict: entering Rafah, and driving out Hamas there is about to start.

So it's time to let more aid in. Nobody wants to see innocent women and children starve. We can't allow that to happen.

Realistically, it isnât feasible for Israel to give into Hamasâs current demands vis-Ã -vis freeing all of the hostages. Just as a reminder, Hamasâs current demand is for Israel to completely withdraw from Gaza, release an enormous number of Palestinian prisoners, and to commit to abide by a ceasefire that will eventually be broken at a time of Hamasâs choosing. I think there are additional demands as well. And remember that Hamas has vowed to carry out October 7âs again and again. Not only would agreeing to this massively embolden Hamas because it would allow it to declare victory and declare itself to be an equal of the IDF (as it did at the end of Operation Protective Edge), but it would legitimize Hamasâs strategy of using Israeli hostages as leverage. Israelis, therefore, would need to live in perpetual fear of another attack and hostage crisis and the Israeli economy would be hugely drained by the need for constant high-level mobilization on Israelâs southern and northern borders. That is not feasible. In the long-run, it would result in more war and very likely more kidnapped Israelis. The only way for a sustained peace is for Hamas to be completely dismantled.

Â &gt;Â Israel is facing its destructionÂ 

Â Again, you **do realize that this is a lie**? We are talking about whether Israel gets to destroy Palestine, and the Palestinians, and whether it gets to continue apartheid and the occupation of Palestinian territory. It has nuclear bombs. The idea that ânot slaughtering people in Gazaâ = âdestruction of Israelâ is laughable.Â 

Â &gt;Â Israel's military has modern weaponry due to its close ties to America. China would love to get this kind of technology. Â 

Sure, Israel can try and turn to China and become the North Korea of the middle east. How well do you think that will work out, for an army and country entirely reliant on US arms, US trade, US subsidies?Â  And the Chinese may be highly unlikely to prop up a regime associated with western imperialism and the opposite side of the Cold War.Â Â 

Â &gt;Â From where I stand, abandoning Israel, telling them to immediately cease fightingÂ 

Â Let me spell it out: appeasement of Israel, like appeasement of Russia, will only remove **any** incentive Israel has to refrain from further slaughter, ethnic cleansing as pushed by the Israeli right, and even genocide (the destruction of Palestinians as a people as pushed by Netanyahu).Â  Unless you also think the US should give arms to Russia, Iran, Syria, Hamas and all the other countries that it currently had sanctions on then the argument that âwe must unconditionally support them otherwise they might do worse things!!â is a non-starter.Â 

Â In diplomacy, unconditional support means you have **zero** leverage. Why should Israel refrain from killing all the people in Rafah if the US promises to support it regardless? What incentive does it have to stop if the weapons keep flowing?Â Â

Besides changing the agreement to 33 live hostages being released in the first phase to 33 total live and remains of hostages, other changes include.

-Release 3 hostages on 3rd day then every week instead of three every 3 days

-Changing phase 1 from 40 days to 42 day. So 18 hostages released until end of 6 week ceasefire then the remaining 33 released 

-Hamas demands 30 prisoners for civilian hostages instead of 20. They want 50 prisoners instead of 40 for female IDF. Presumably this exchange is for live and remains of hostages.

-Israel cannot veto any requests for prisoners serving hard time for murder. Previously they had a set number of vetos. Israel also canât exile them to Gaza.

-On the first day of the ceasefire, 50 Hamas terrorists can go through Rafah for medical treatment, higher than the number Israel agreed to.

-The IDF will with withdraw on the 3rd day. Previous proposal said IDF would withdraw on 7th day, which corresponded when all women would have been released (hostage release every 3 days). So IDF withdrawal on first day of hostage release.

-On the 22nd day all prisoners re-arrested since the Shilat deal are released. This was not in initial proposal at all.

-A big concession on Israelâs part was allowing unrestricted return including military age men to north without checkpoints. They had already agreed to it. According to the Hamas changes, guns, ammunition and other materials that can be used to make weapons would also be sent to the north.

Biden isn't even against eliminating Hamas or a Rafah operation, but one that isn't humane. He has suggested alternatives but Bibi has rejected them.

You're never gonna get rid of terrorism unless you decide to kill everyone. People become Hamas when they become radicalized and they become radicalized when you indiscriminately kill civilians without any care for their lives, which is what is happening with Rafah's invasion.

1075,"From your linked article, Hamas made that offer on Oct 9 or 10. Israel invaded Gaza on Oct 27, even though the military was ready way before that. This period is attributed to attempts at negotiation, but Hamas probably never agreed to return all the hostages. Remember that the hostages are Hamasâs only card. They canât return all of them as they wonât be able to threaten Israel if they break any part of a deal, unless that deal will somehow force Israel to not attack Hamas.

Israel on the other hand canât just accept Hamas massacring and raping more than a thousand citizens, accept the hostages back and act as if nothing happened. It would only invite another massacre. Israel has to send a message that nothing will be gained from terror.

If your kid slaps you because you donât give him ice cream, do you just ignore him? Do you give him a little ice cream and then ignore him? No, you teach punish him for that slap. 

As evident, the military pressure is what brought many of the hostages back. Military operations brought 3 other hostages alive, and many bodies. âNot attackingâ brought no one back.

As for the current situation, I agree to your point that recent actions are not making much sense. Israelâs government had sunk into politics, and instead of entering Rafah as if itâs just another part of Gaza they waited and allowed it to blow up as if Rafah is not just half sand dunes. It also wouldâve put much more pressure on Hamas to agree to a deal.

Bibi is surely prolonging the war, and Iâm sure he does it for his own selfish reasons, but I hate that people donât realize that we have to finish what we started. A permanent cease fire is not an option. Instead of wasting resources pressuring for a cease fire that wonât happen, we need to pressure Israel to just finish the war. Clear Gaza from Hamas, ignore Biden, find an alternative and pull out. If thereâs a good alternative they would help israel find the hostages themselves.

1080,Is it true Israel is trying to barge in Rafah during Taraweeh prayer?,5/7/2024 14:18,Neutral
1081,"So I think you miss a lot of things actually,   
The first is that in the first sentence you claim that Hamas did nothing wrong before October 7th. This is obviously not true, as they have launched too many terror attacks to count, targeting Israeli civilians or firing indiscriminate missiles into Israeli territory - all this time while abusing the Palestinians they themself control by killing every opposition, by teaching them hate in their schools and media and by stealing huge portions of their aid money. And also - by starting escalations with Israel every now and then that have negative effects on the Palestinians.  

The truth is that Hamas is not the good guys that were pushed to the edge, they are the current representatives of the Ideology that wants to violently destroy Israel, kill or ethnically cleanse the Israelis/Jews.. sadly this ideology is too prevalent in the Palestinian society, so groups like Hamas can rise to power. but it's also a self preserving cycle where Hamas controls the media and education and making more Palestinians follow their ideology. 

Even in the UN resolution, Hamas isn't justified in targeting civilians or firing missiles indiscriminately - which every missile that Hamas has is indiscriminate by definition. October 7th was mostly attacking civilians. there was some attacking of soldiers in a base, but the large part of the fighting happened in the civilian cities when the IDF came to rescue civilians and fight Hamas.  Hamas definitely sanctioned these - even the idea of trying to go to a Kibutz and attack people (which the Hamas terrorists had direct plans on doing) is illegal, and a crime under international law. Also, the missiles are sanctioned, and they are illegal as well (since they are indiscriminate). There are plenty of evidence that this was planned, including even the sexual violence part.

Notice - Hamas didn't take prisoners - it took hostages. you could maybe say that the IDF soldiers they took are prisoners (though I'm not sure whether international law would agree on this, since it depends if we're talking about ongoing armed conflict or not), but most of the people that Hamas took are civilians and thus hostages. 

Generally speaking I think that when you say ""Israel imprisons Palestinians without a trial"" is a bit misleading. Israel does imprison Palestinians with trials. most of the Palestinians in Israeli prisons are after trial. There is what's called administrative detention, where Israel extends the arrest of Palestinians (and also Israelis btw) without a trial in certain cases in order to allegedly gather evidence, and some people claim that Israel over-uses this tool (including myself), but generally speaking it's the minority of Palestinians in Israeli prisons as it's almost always much shorter duration compared to actual imprisonment.

Hamas also likely didn't treat the hostages well. For instance [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/middleeast/hamas-hostage-sexual-assault.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/middleeast/hamas-hostage-sexual-assault.html) . it's a hard read. many other hostages expressed on this, and they describe pretty horrible conditions and treatment by Hamas. Hamas claims it treats the hostages well and tried to stage their release as such, but I personally prefer believing the hostages themselves who are regular people rather than a corrupt terrorist organization.  I'm also not familiar with Israel killing prisoners as a policy. I think there was a talk about creating a special law that would allow to give a death sentence to the people who attacked on the 7th of October, but I don't think it passed yet.

You seem to be OK with Hamas spending the aid money that was meant for the Palestinian people on weapons - it's crazy to me. I agree that there are other rights the Palestinians are lacking - most notably the right of self determination, and the right to live freely. but it's exactly these attacks and weapons that prevent these rights from the Palestinians enjoying these rights. Think about it, there isn't a fundamental right of the Palestinians to remove all Israelis from the land, nor does international law supports that - this is what Hamas wants, and it attacked Israel so many times before to try and fail the peace process. 2 states is something that would give the Palestinians all of these rights, and yet Hamas actively hurts the chances of it by spending the money on missiles. so actually it takes money that was meant to help the Palestinians and spends it in a way that takes away their rights.

I agree that Egypt shouldn't take the Palestinians since they have a home, but I'd highly support a temporary refuge, just like happened to Ukrainian citizens that other countries took in order to avoid them being in the middle of a war. this is generally how wars work, and it's a shame no country agreed to take Palestinians in temporarily.

1091,"short version:

basically the reime used to be in the begining anti-Israel, but the great shift happened after 1973's war as Egypt changed the team from Soviet to the US, since then the state of Egypt became so friendly with Zionists because of the US economic ""generousness"" on Egyptian military, and the regime knows that the US will keep backing it as long as they keep Israel safe from Egyptians themselves

long version (repost):

after the 1956 coup Egypt became under a dictatorship as Gamal Abdul-Nasser was the president back then, he was a charismatic leader who was seen as the savior who will throw Israel to the sea and unify the Arab world but in reality he cares about his own image more than achieving his said goals, little the Egyptians (and the rest of Arabs) know that he doesn't only bark and don't bite, but also his regime was too fragile to protect itself from Mossad's penetration, leading to have many Mossad agents close enough to Nasser and his fellow ""free officers"" movement members.

after the war of 1967, Egypt has lost both Gaza (which used to be under his control) and Sinai, because of the incompetence of Egyptian intelligence (and other factors) this event shattered the dream of freeing Palestine and unifying the Arab world, and after his death, Anwar Saddat bacame the president, this guy despite him had been one of Nasser's close friends, he didn't share the same ambitions or ideologies, Nasser was more pro-Soviet, while Saddat was pro-US, Nasser was a Pan-Arabist while Saddat cares only about taking back Sinai and not giving a damn about Palestine.

and in 1973, Egypt was ready to go for another war with Israel, this time and with the help of Genral Shazli, the Egyptian Army was able to make a significant progress against the Israeli defense lines in Sinai. things were going fine for the Egyptians under the General's orders until surprisingly Saddat orders Egyptian forces to rush (despite the General's protests of potential defeat if they didn't stick to the plan and timing, but again it's the dictator's orders) which leads to a stalemate (while both sides claimed victory) ruining the whole plan of defeating Israel once and for all.

the US came and both of Egypt and Israel started negotiating, Kissinger (may he burn in hell) was there and was surprised to see how Saddat was so ""open"" to Israel's demands, Israel didn't want the PLO to be a part of negotiation nor want the Egyptian to mention ""Palestine"", and Saddat was like ""fine"", Kissinger (may he burn in hell) said that Saddat was supposed to be the one who demands Israelis and not the opposite, as he accepts almost all Israel's conditions, like recognizing it, forbidding the army from reaching some areas in Sinai, and finally abandoning one Egyptian city used to be called ""Oum Rashrash"" to the Israelis which is now called ""Eilat"" for strategic purposes, this ""submission"" was not only for the exchange of Sinai only (minus 1 city), but also because the US promised the Egyptian regime of giving them annual ""financial help"" once the normalization happens, Saddat was more than happy to agree and went to Jerusalem to meet with Israel's prime minister at the time. and he also showed no interests towards taking back Gaza or establishing a Palestinian state.

because of the ""annual"" help from the US, the Egyptian regime found itself in need to be in good relations with Israel, that's why Israel kept building network of spies inside Egypt in order to dominate its regime, and it was a successful attempt as Israel had access in many Egyptian facilities and ministries, the Egyptian military became a puppet in the hands of Zionists and westerners. But it wasn't all sunshines and rainbows for Saddat since he got Assassinated (either by an Islamist or an Army member).

then his vice president Hosni Mubarak came to power, he was smarter than the previous presidents, as he knew how to deal with Israelis without pissing off Egyptians, as he let the people express as much hate towards Zionists as they want, while he keeps friendly with Israel, that's why he stays in power for 30 years until 2011.

during 2011's Arab spring, Egyptians had revolted against Mubarak's regime, they had enough of sheer corruption and authoritarianism, meanwhile Israel along with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the Egyptian deep state (the military) were worried about the shift that's happening in Egypt towards democracy, because if the people start ruling themselves that means the end of military dictatorship, cutting relations with Israel and preparing for another war against it, and the spread of revolutionary ideas in Gulf states (already was in Bahrain). that's why after the first election (2012) and the win of an Islamist party of presidency, Israel, KSA, UAE, and the Egyptian deep state were preparing for a counter-revolution.

President Mohammed Morsi was the first democratically elected president in Egyptian history (hopefully not the last for so long), and he was clear from the beginning about Israel, he was anti-Israel, it's true that he didn't want to engage in a war against Zionists, but he was more than ready to support Gaza economically and socially and open the Rafah border. Also he was in good relations with Obama's administration and follows the basic protocols when it comes to dealing with the Israelis. meanwhile the counter-revolution gang was searching for a guy in Egypt to lead the second coup, the guy was named ""Abdel Fatah Al-Sissi"" an Ambitious military intelligence member who was trusted by the elected president himself, little did Morsi know that he's gonna get backstabbed.

Sissi was planning for the coup since the 2011 revolution, he got supported by the deep state, then gained the trust of the Brotherhood party by looking ""Islamist enough"" then he secretly met with Israelis and ensure them that they have nothing to fear as long as they support him, then finally got supported by KSA and UAE ensuring both regimes that he will crush the revolution and the Muslim brotherhood (and their supporters)

The deep state started using its own media and important figures to attack the government and cause economic instability, while Israel and the UAE started lobbying in the white house in order to convince Americans to back up the upcoming coup, the KSA was financing the upcoming counter-revolution, and after only 1 year of Morsi's administration precisely during 30/06/2013, the president went to Jail with the charge of ""supporting terrorism"" (since he was in good relations with Hamas) and being an agent for (wait for it) ""Israel, Iran, and Qatar""!

General Sissi then went to crush Morsi's supporters (literally) like how he did in Raba'a Massacre, then he jailed important revolutionary figures that have nothing to do with Islamists, Israel approved the coup and said later that Sissi is their man in Egypt, and after almost one year of the coup, Sissi was ""elected"" to be the new president who vows to ""crush the terrorists who ruined the country"", he closed the Rafah border to suffocate Gaza even more, then his military started his own genocide against the Egyptians in Sinai (because Israel said they were all terrorists), then went and helped Israel in many occasions like striking a Gas-deal with Israel that only benefits Israelis, setting off fire in Israel using Egyptian helicopters, supporting Jarred Kushner's deal of ""peace"" in the middle east ( the word""unfair"" isn't enough to describe it), saying that ""the safety of the Israeli is as important as the safety of the Israeli"" (yes you've read that right), supporting the Abraham accords despite that it would limit Egypt's role being a mediator between Israelis and Palestinians, giving to Islands to KSA in order to make the waters international to facilitate Israel's movement in the red sea, and many more... oh and he looks REALLY happy when Netenyahu visits him",5/7/2024 4:32,Pro-Palestine
1092,"I kinda see most of these points as null if you actually look at history. I would like to firstly state however Israel has done some bad things and I condemn them, but I still side with the guys who don't want to wipe the [Jews off the planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Hamas_charter), have a large percentage of the population who just want to despise gay people ([Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Ahmad_Abu_Murkhiyeh)), and [vote in a terrorist group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election) (Hamas won 44.45% of the vote and Fatah, another terrorist group, won 41.43% of the vote).

  
1. Israel hasn't been perfect but they have done a lot of good for the people around them, [unless helping the persecuted Ethiopian Jews is evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Solomon), or signing peace treaties to try and end the conflict. They have [also have given aid to Gaza](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/01/middleeast/gaza-aid-israel-restrictions-investigation-intl-cmd/index.html), [offered fuel and incubators to the Al-Shifa hospital](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2023/11/14/israel-offers-incubators-for-gazas-shifa-hospital/), and have been the only proper democracy in the middle east.

2. Under the Israeli law Arabs have full right to vote in elections and hold citizenship in the country, [they are as equal as everyone else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel). They can also choose to serve in the military, which is not mandatory for them. 

In regards to the 'Flour Massacre' it is certainly tragic to see so many civilians die, but if you actually watch the drone footage they were [ransacking the truck and being aggressive](https://www.timesofisrael.com/dozens-of-gazans-said-killed-in-stampede-for-aid-idf-opens-fire-blamed-for-deaths/). The investigation showed that it had become dangerous for the IDF members as they were being rushed. Before opening fire they had fired warning shots to scare the crowd away from rushing them, along with the fact that the front trucks were opened fire on. Also it is seen that the majority of the casualties were done by the trucks (which were being shot at), which were driven by private contractors, meaning that private citizens who were helping deliver aid but not apart of the military were both shot, at while trying to help, and forced to hit people to escape. This was not a peaceful group of people sitting around and waiting for aid this was essentially a riot that was endangering the lives of the IDF and private contractors.

3. None, the Palestinians should've signed any of the peace offerings from the [1937 Peel Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Commission) to the [Trump Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_peace_plan) plan (I will acknowledge not all were perfect including the Trump one, but any number of them could've been signed that were equal for both sides). 

4. Israel, unlike Hamas, does obey international law, with them using [civilians as human shields](https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas_human_shields.pdf) and [targeting civilians](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mde210062006en.pdf). Both of which are against the laws of war. Israel has also been known to throw and try its members [who commit war crimes or other atrocities](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/12244) (this is one instance). As for protecting terrorists, Israel has a law prohibiting the existence of graves of terrorists, this was known as the [Baruch Goldstein Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Goldstein). I will need you to site the source that says they protect zionist terrorists because clearly they don't like them.

Unanimous support for starvation? I cannot fathom that this is true.

Democratic governments can still slip up and make mistakes against the will of the people. Look at how many people in the US want free healthcare from their democratic government. Did their will ever come true? What about US citizens were against the Iraq war which Bush went ahead and commenced anyway?

Furthermore, I would stay away from words like genocide, it makes it lose meaning and takes away from what is happening.

If Israel is wanting to genocide Palestinians, theyâd be launching a full scale ground and aerial invasion of Rafah. They have the military ability to be doing more damage and the deaths wouldâve been higher if they werenât actively trying to avoid civilians.

Even the Air Supply Package dropped by US recently killed 5 civilians by landing!

&gt;The IDF announced the death of 19-year-old Israeli soldier Noa Marciano, who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.

&gt;On Monday night, Hamas published a video of Marciano from captivity, more than five weeks after she was kidnapped during the October 7 attacks on Israel.

&gt;Marciano was serving as a lookout on Kibbutz Nahal Oz and taken into Gaza along with around 240 other Israelis.

&gt;The IDF said that it had sent officers to talk to Marcianoâs family after publication of the video. In a photograph released a week or so after the Hamas attack, a bound Marciano was shown with three other hostages. A week later, the IDF officially informed her family that she had been kidnapped and taken into Gaza.

&gt;âOur hearts are with the Marciano family, whose daughter, Noa, was cruelly kidnapped by the Hamas terrorist organization,â the military said. âHamas continues to use psychological terror and to act inhumanely, sending videos and photographs of captives, as it has done in the past.â

&gt;Marciano was from Modiâin, and served in the Combat Intelligence Collection Corps of the 414th Regiment. Her mother, Adi, last spoke to her on October 7 at 7:30 A.M. âShe told me she was in a protected space and that there had been an infiltration,â she said in an interview. âShe said that she had to end the call. I didnât hear shots or screams. Half an hour later, I sent her a message, but she didnât reply.â

It says virtually everyone in Gaza is struggling to get enough food, and that around 677,000 people â nearly a third of the population of 2.3 million â are experiencing the highest level of catastrophic hunger. That includes around 210,000 people in the north.

Again, the basic human right of self-determination.

False.  They invaded Canaan and became a client state of whatever the ruling empire was.  As they're a client state of the west today.

&gt;Israelites have been living here for 10,000+ years

False.

&gt;Palestinians on the other hand have been brought here in waves transforming the existing people through assimilation into a wholly foreign entity.

Laughably false.

&gt;I didnât know he was a Palestinian leader, tell me more about that.

Some crazy terrorists occupying Palestine elected that german national socialist supporter their prime minister.  I don't know why.  They have weird ideas about ""justice"" being anything that's good for them, ignoring the rights of anyone else.  I guess maybe that's their connection with the ww2 germans, seems like a similar ideology.

&gt;Netanyahu making a populist lie doesnât erase the truth of the matter.

That's exactly what it does.  Though it makes you wonder about the holocaust denying population netanyahu was appealing to with his self-serving lies...

You know, if you ever take any interest in the history of Palestine...

&gt;Since you havenât established what about being native gives anyone inherent land rights, I disagree.

Native self-determination.  For the third time?

&gt;The reason a Russian occupation of Crimea is illegitimate is because theyâre taking over a population by force simply because they want the land; were they threatened by Ukraine repeatedly as casus belli Iâd see an occupation of Crimea as completely legitimate. 

So exactly the same as the violent european zionist terrorists.  Glad we agree on one thing.

&gt;No, they werenât; they were immigrants who legally purchased the land they dwelled on.

False.  Anyone that knows any history of the region knows that couldn't be further from the truth.

I mean...  ffs, just think for one second...  You honestly think that the european zionist terrorists legally bough all privately owned land in Palestine, fairly paying market rate to the native Palestinian owners...

You just seem to know literally nothing whatsoever about the history of the region.  Not the first thing.

&gt;You keep calling them foreign invaders when theyâre an indigenous people making a return

They weren't.

The hebrew tribe as you should know, originated in Babylonia in the Ur of Chaldes in modern Iraq.

1134,"âJerusalem, Nov 25 (EFE).- Palestinian militant group Hamas thanked Prime Ministers Pedro Sanchez of Spain and Alexander De Croo of Belgium on Saturday for their âclear and bold stanceâ on the ongoing Gaza war.

Sanchez and Croo condemned the killing of innocent civilians, including thousands of children, in the war between Israel and the Islamist group in the Gaza Strip.

âWe appreciate the clear and bold stance of Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Crooâ¦ and of Spainâs Pedro Sanchez,â Hamas said in a statement.

The Hamas statement recalled that Croo denounced the destruction of Gaza and the killing of civilians in the besieged Palestinian strip.

âSanchez condemned the indiscriminate killings by the occupying state in the strip and pointed out the possibility that his country may unilaterally recognize the Palestinian state if the European Union does not take this step,â the Hamas statement said.

The two European leaders held a press conference on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing on Friday, just before the release of the first Israeli hostages.

They urged Hamas to release all captives and Israel to fulfill its obligations under international law.

âThe time has come for the international community and the European Union to recognize the state of Palestine,â said Sanchez. âBut if this is not the case, of course, Spain will take its own decisions.â

Hamas called on the world to âstand on the side of justice and the Palestinian cause,â and support âthe bold stances against the occupation.â

The group demanded the end of âaggression and genocidal war against the Palestinian people.â

On Thursday, SÃ¡nchez and De Croo visited Israel, received by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Isaac Herzog, and Foreign Minister Eli Cohen.

After the press conference in Rafah, the Israeli foreign ministry summoned the ambassadors of Spain and Belgium to explain the comments by their prime ministers.

Israelâs Foreign Minister Eli Cohen condemned the âfalse claims by the Spanish and Belgian leaders that âsupport terrorism.â

Spain and Belgium have also summoned Israeli ambassadors to separate meetings.

âThe accusations are totally false and unacceptable, and we reject them categorically,â said Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares. EFEâ",5/1/2024 2:41,Pro-Palestine

His response is a little confusing, but I think it's basically: vehicle inspections are a major bottleneck, but also the trucks can't just go where they need to go and unload they have to be unloaded again, and the cargo re-loaded.  (It isn't clear if that's due to UNRWA policy or it's a rule the IDF imposed.)  It's also an active war zone and actually getting the trucks to their destination isn't always straightforward.

&gt;Kelly: I interviewed the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog, yesterday and I asked him about aid. He was very critical of the U.N. He essentially blamed the U.N. for the bottleneck in getting aid into Gaza. He says the U.N. could be getting more aid in if you wanted. How do you respond to that?  
&gt;
&gt;Lazzarini: Well, that's true. We could have much, much more if Israel would allow more trucks to come in.  
&gt;
&gt; Today, for example, we had only 46 truck coming from Kerem Shalom and a hundred trucks coming from Rafah. So basically, despite the reopening of the crossing, we do not have overall additional trucks coming into the Gaza Strip. What we need is something much more meaningful because what we are getting today is far from enough to respond to such a crisis.  
&gt;
&gt;Kelly: I just want to stay on for this for a minute because it's obviously incredibly frustrating to hear Israel is blaming the U.N. I just heard you say, you know, if Israel would open the crossings and keep them open, we could get more in. How do you break the impasse?  
&gt;Lazzarini: Listen, you have many bottlenecks. First of all, you have still ongoing bombardment â roads which have been destroyed, trucks which have been destroyed.
&gt;
&gt;When trucks come in, they are not allowed to go to the final destination. They have to download and then you have to re-offload.  
If we would let trucks go into the final destination, you can let trucks come in in the hundreds, and this would not be a problem. So the bottleneck is a series of issues related to the conflict but also to administrative procedure.",4/30/2024 20:22,Neutral

I completely disagree with the sentiment that being pro-Palestinian is the same as being pro-Hamas. BUT this conflict is incredibly nuanced and a lot of statements and opinions that pro-Palestinians share believing to be innocent I and others find extreme, offensive and borderline antisemitic.

I look at such statements and believe most of the people saying them don't hold the views I associate with the message itself. Other people look at those statements, think the message is anti-Israel or antisemetic and therefore the person who voiced that message is pro-Hamas.

Heck, even Palestinians are afraid of hamas , and if there's an election, they may get elected again out of fear by the public. 

I'm not convinced with you knowing what you're supporting unless if you're telling me that you are of the same religion as the hamas terror group, then it explains why we're having this conversation. Else, your support should go to the Palestinians, and if you don't condemn the acts done on Oct 7, you're quite insane. 

Just an additional note, if hamas attacked on Oct 7 and it only included  bombing and going around shooting .. that can still be said as inflicting what Israel has done to them all these years, all those additional stuff above..  they are just striking fear to everyone else... which is exactly what a terror group does... figgting with another hamas yeam member to get the turn to habe your first kill, and gaining joy out of attempting to behead an innocent unarmed person (not even jew) on the ground with a garden hoe while shouting and praising your God all these while recording and livestreaming it .. is no way a normal war act.

The area of the fire is hundreds of meters from the area of the strike.

The weapon used was a GBU-39, literally called the SDB (small diameter bomb).  It is a relatively small weapon, not capable of what's seen in the images.

The videos that have come to light seem to show secondary explosions, which would be consistent with something flamable/explosive detonating after the strike.

Hamas has admitted that two of it's senior leaders were killed in the strike.

Hamas has demonstrably been storing weapons in and around civilian areas.

The leading theory is that the strike hit it's intended target, the two Hamas leaders, who happened to be hanging out in/around an area where their rockets were being stored.  The rockets cooked off/detonated after the strike, and it was *these explosions* that caused the fire in the camp.

1225,"&gt;I'm not sure specifically what proof you look for, but there are photos which suggest that rape happened, and a captured Hamas terrorist saying it, and witnesses saying it.

There is no evidence of it. (I don't consider admission under torture to be evidence at all.) If it had happened, it would have been relatively quick and easy to find the evidence on the bodies. Instead, the [Israeli excuse](https://www.timesofisrael.com/amid-war-and-urgent-need-to-id-bodies-evidence-of-hamass-october-7-rapes-slips-away/) is that they were too busy prioritizing the identification of corpses. I don't believe that for one second they would have allowed to pass the chance to have evidence of sexual crimes by Hamas.

&gt;As for Amnesty, they even say themselves that Hamas had a presence in al-Shifa, before this war. We also have countless videos of Palestinian rocket launches from within civilian areas. So yeah, they use human shields.

Of course Hamas had a presence in the hospital. But that is very different from it being ""Hamas headquarters"". It is obviously not, or the initial slew of ""evidence"" would've been far less questionable.

&gt;This argument doesn't really make sense. Even if every single person is removed from Gaza, that wouldn't change Israeli demographics at all, because Gaza is not part of Israel.

The argument does make sense. Israel has continually annexed the surrounding region; it's obvious that they want the land to be under their control, and if it is under their control, they are going to have to deal with the pesky civilians residing there which don't fit their ethnic qualifications.

Even if, due to international outcry, Israel is not allowed to directly claim the land -- they still do not want any potential hostiles there, and they still want to maintain control through occupation.

&gt;Hamas actually is in the West Bank. Who told you they aren't there? There are also other terrorist groups there.

I do not condone any attacks against the Israeli civilian families, and children.itâs the threat Israel sent but October 7th is the only headline that dozens of others use to justify the brutality invasion in Gaza, tons of buildings destroyed, dozens of hospitals not functioning with no anesthesia to treat any injury, pregnancy, and severe treatment of any kind, with the highest levels of famine happening right now, people on the rise to be dying from malnutrition and starvation, hunger,etc. Netanyahu just stated that, theyâre going with the plan to invade Rafah.

He is one of the most delusional, arrogant individuals on this earth.

Also, Britain and London, and many others are protesting ongoing, are having an uprising for standing up for whatâs happening in Gaza,  many Jews, and citizens are coming forward as they say Judaism and Zionism are two different things, and whatâs happening in Gaza doesnât represent their identity, and beliefs from their Jewish community, and many others becoming to stand for humanity with those of a humanitarian crisis.


It is despicable enough of the propaganda fueling this fire with so much hate, lies, and manipulation. Premature birth mothers will likely die due to the energy they donât have due to starvation, hunger, and no treatment.

How much more is there needed to be said? I listened to a video of a guy speaking at the podium, whoâs a FATHER, he said a Palestinian woman in Gaza who was rolled over to where she was splitting in half until the fetus came out.

My last point is: If one sides cries for the Israeli hostages to be released, what does that leave the last remaining of Gaza, will the Palestinian hostages be released, too? If Israel were to eliminate Hamas, âwill the killing against Palestinians be done with or IDF soldiers will continue and destroy all of Gaza until there is no more?

In the holocaust for example about 1/4 of the victims died in 100 days between August and October 1942, the Rwandan genocide lasted for 100 days and more than 800,000 were murdered in it. On the other hand in this war about 23,000 Palestinians have died in 100 days, according to IDF reports 9,000 of them were Hamas terrorists, while we donât have accurate reports for how much were actually Hamas terrorists, if the IDF claim will be found as true (or even in smaller numbers like 6,000 Hamas terrorists) then it shows that the IDF is indeed careful, considering that itâs an urban warfare, and the fact that Hamas themselves publish videos where it can be clearly seen that theyâre not using uniforms, both things doesnât make this case any simpler.

Okay, and what actual evidence has been presented? Simply having more journalists around doesn't necessarily accomplish very much, but it does help the career of a lot of journalists a lot, and sounds good as a PR sound bite.

&gt; Of course Israel and Egypt have had an agreement this entire war to ban journalists from ever entering. Again read the many links Iâve provided above and yet another below they say in their open letters or reporting for âIsrael and Egyptâ to lift the ban.

You can literally see the contradiction to this in the lead quote:

&gt;&gt;In an unusually frank comment to the media on 16 November, of which RSF has obtained an audio recording, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said âany unilateral actionâ by Egypt as regards letting journalists into Gaza **might be seen [by Israel] as âinappropriateâ** and might âhave adverse consequences to other componentsâ of the arrangement between Egypt and Israel, such as âthe entry of assistance.â

This isn't in violation of any explicit agreement in other words, Egypt at best doesn't want to draw Israel's ire (a relationship they were already willing to threaten over the invasion of Rafah), and at worst is just shifting blame because that's quick and easy. As we read down the article this is reinforced:

&gt;&gt;âThis buck-passing between Israel and Egypt, in which each blames the other for the denials of access, **shows that the two governments have a mutual interest in preventing international media coverage of the situation in the Gaza Strip**. Israel is primarily responsible for this news blockade, but Egypt has continued to be complicit in recent weeks. You cannot pretend to deplore bias in the mediaâs coverage of the war while at the same time preventing journalists from going there.

Egypt and Israel don't have an explicit agreement, at least not one we know about, and again, lets go back to how this conversation started, which was the idea that this was a unilateral Israeli coverup, which this seems makes painfully evident just isn't true.

[I would point out that actually, you can both deplore bias and prevent journalists from entering Gaza, and it is probably to news agency's detriment that they don't try to fix their reporting, because while I don't really agree Israel should keep them out over this, there have been a lot of coverage trends that really are low-quality even from available information.]

And the article ends on a stinger that specifically singles out *Egypt* and says this isn't something that started with October 7th (so Israel's specific conduct now is not the root of this stance):

&gt;&gt;âThere is a culture of censorship, especially in this part of Sinai at Palestineâs gates, that pre-dates the attack by Hamas,â said a journalist based in Egypt for the past ten years who asked not to be identified.

1. Everyone around the Lebanon border (which has been fired into relentlessly on a daily basis since October 7th, despite having a very Very clear border with Israel and not being ""occupied"" by it, and is now also physically on fire because of the shelling) and around the gaza border have been evacuated. About 200,000 thousand israelis have been displaced. Turning these areas to a dmz would first off: demand re-homing 200,000 people in an already tiny country which is 60% desert land, and secondly would absolutely encourage hamas and any other terrorist group that might be inspired to group by it's actions, or that currently exists, to repeat October 7th again and again, seeing as they can ""push back"" the israelies while slaughtering them, which is the Islamist's wet dream. In edition, trying to get foreign forces to enforce these dmzs would require foreign nations to actually cooperate and send their own armies into the middle east- definitely not something thry are intrested i. Doing (believe me even if they did, everyone currently protesting Israel would not be happy anyway, since they would still see it as ""foreign interference enforcing the occupation"" or whatever).
""Discuss if Israel is to big to control military""-, dude, what does this mean? Israel is smaller than new jersey, it's smaller than Vancouver island, you can get to the absolute most northern point to the most southern in less than 6 hours, and at it's widest point it's only about 131 k""m wide (at it's narrowist, without the west bank, its 13km).

Do you think bombing weapons caches and launch pads, which horrifically are placed within civilian infrastructures, is not focusing on defense? How can a government promise it's civilians safety from mass hoards of insane coked out (lots of drugs were found on the bodies of the hamas terrorists, look it up, there is photographic evidence) terrorists who want to rape and burn them alive, or promise safety to send you kids to school without a rocket hitting they're classroom  (for an example, [this school being hit in ashkelon 3 years ago ](https://www.israelhayom.com/2021/05/11/asheklon-school-sustains-direct-hit-no-casulaties-reported/) . This has happened a ton of times but it's hard to find reports on it in English for some reason it's as if the media has a bias or something ð¤) if it ""focuses on defence"" like you state? What does that mean focusing on defence? Doing what? Sitting and waiting for disaster to happen? Cool that's what we've been doing since 2005, and when we retaliate to eliminate the threat aka defence, the world basically tells us that we are genocidal maniacs and we need to shut up and take it in the *ss, because apparently war is all about symmetry and civility and not about opposing ideologies and people willing to murder to defend those ideogies.
-""you can keep the borders safe for 100 years you will have peace. , if Israel keeps its control over Gaza/westbank and attack them once in a while you will keep destabilizing and things will always be stirred up.""
Again my dude. What the f is this? What are you talking about? What does this mean? Do you think we just ""attack"" for fun? Do you think the Palestinians are just having a tea party enjoying their day and we just decide to f**k s**t up? Do you think we wouldn't have secured the border if it was easy? Every single round of fighting and war we have had with the Palestinians was a retaliation to some form of act of aggression. Look it up.

In late April Euro-Med Human Rights monitor estimated that approximately 70,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Gaza, during the six month period between October 7 and April 24. 70,000 tons of bombs on the Gaza Strip since October 2023 far surpasses the bombing of Dresden, Hamburg, and London combined during World War II.  
  
President Biden continues to supply and fund Israel while knowing since October 2023 that Israel has been targeting civilians. On May 14, he approved another one billion dollars to fund weapons for Israel. This is continued participation in Israelâs genocide of Palestinians and a violation of Leahy Law, which prohibits our government from funding foreign forces who are implicated in gross human rights violations.  
  
International scholar and lawyer, Francesca Albanese, has documented how Israelâs gross human rights violations and war crimes are genocidal acts, including their targeting of hospitals and healthcare workers, targeting journalists and civilians, using starvation as a weapon, etc. Israeli government officials have repeatedly expressed genocidal intent. Sites of learning, culture, and historical memory â universities, mosques, churches, museums â have been decimated. The Gaza Strip's ability to produce food and clean water has been severely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes and bulldozers which have razed farms and orchards. People have unearthed mass graves with evidence of torture. Israel is ignoring the I.C.J. ruling on May 24 to halt the offensive on Rafah. The U.S. stands alone in vetoing Palestineâs request for U.N. membership. The U.S. continues to ignore the U.N. resolution on March 25 for a ceasefire. As people of conscience, we will not ignore this.  
  
I am demanding you to take immediate steps to stop Israelâs genocide of Palestinians by calling for 1) a total and permanent bilateral ceasefire (which is what a ceasefire is), 2) humanitarian aid allowed to enterÂ Gaza, 3) an endÂ to Israel'sÂ siege on Gaza,Â 4) the release of all Palestinian and Israeli hostages, 5)Â no more weapons or funding to the Israeli military, 6) the reinstatement of U.N.R.W.A funding.Â A permanent ceasefire is an absolutely critical step to ensuring everlasting liberation and peace.  
  
The I.C.J. ruled that Israel should do everything in its power to prevent genocide. Never again means never again for anyone. Palestinians deserve to live with freedom and safety which means first stopping this genocide and then ensuring liberation from occupation and apartheid. The liberation and safety of Palestinians, Israelis, Jewish people, and Muslim people are intertwined. There can only be true safety when we are all free from oppression.

1266,"&gt; May 30 (Reuters) - Hamas said on Thursday it had told mediators it would not take part in more negotiations during ongoing aggression but was ready for a ""complete agreement"" including an exchange of hostages and prisoners if Israel stopped the war.

&gt; Talks, mediated by among others Egypt and Qatar, to arrange a ceasefire between Israel and the Islamist movement in the Gaza war have repeatedly stalled with both sides blaming the other for the lack of progress.
The latest Hamas statement came as Israel pressed on with an offensive on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, despite an order by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the top U.N. court, to halt the attacks.

&gt; ""Hamas and the Palestinian factions will not accept to be part of this policy by continuing (ceasefire) negotiations in light of the aggression, siege, starvation and genocide of our people"", the Hamas statement read.

&gt; ""Today, we informed the mediators of our clear position that if the occupation stops its war and aggression against our people in Gaza, our readiness (is) to reach a complete agreement that includes a comprehensive exchange deal,"" it added.

&gt; Israel has rejected past Hamas offers as insufficient and said it is determined to wipe out a group bent on its destruction. It says its Rafah offensive is focused on rescuing hostages and rooting out Hamas fighters.
Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive across all of Gaza, the health ministry there says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7 last year, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Basically Hamas is continuing to push for their original agreement which is ludicrous as it basically amounts to a slap on the wrist for Hamas and the chance for them to do this all again later.

Also for Hamas to give back hostages of which they can't even verify if any are still alive at this point anyways.

It's a rubbish deal for Israel but because they keep rejecting it Hamas claims Israel is terrible and the aggressor and evil even though they started this whole thing in the first place... 

Hamas wants to basically reset the board to try again in 10 or 20 years time. Israel has had enough of this nonsense.

What they want is to get rid of Israel. Palestinian national identity is largely defined by opposition to the idea of a Jewish state in the region. It only really started to even be talked about in the late 19th to early 20th century, and it didn't reach a critical mass until the 20s/30s, as it became increasingly clear that the British were actually gonna follow through on partitioning the mandate and giving some of it to *Jews*. Hell, *Arab* independence really only started to be a thing around WW1 as the ottomans started pushing their culture on the locals.

The Palestinians didn't care about not getting their own land. The British gave a huge chunk to the Hashemite dynasty, who were from Saudi Arabian, as thanks for their help in ww1. That chunk became modern day Jordan, which literally annexed the West bank in 1948, and the Palestinians were totally fine with all of that.

1. Was Jerusalem the capital of the Jewish state during King David (around 1000 BC)?

yes. it was. [wiki about Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jerusalem).

[yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(636%E2%80%93637)#:~:text=In%20637%20or%20638%2C%20Caliph,Patriarch%20thus%20surrendered%20to%20him.&amp;text=The%20Muslim%20conquest%20of%20the%20city%20solidified%20Arab%20control%20over,the%20First%20Crusade%20in%201099).

 

3. What was the purpose of The Crusades?

 The Crusades were a series of religious wars between Christians and Muslims started primarily **to secure control of holy sites considered sacred by both groups**. In all, eight major Crusade expeditionsâvarying in size, strength and degree of successâoccurred between 1096 and 1291.

 Israel won its war for independence by **superior organization and preparation and by using truces to regain its strength.** the arab armies while bigger werent very organized together. also, in wars afterwards, israel grew significantly with the 800,000 mizrahi jews coming into israel in the 40s-70s.

 

5. Is true that in 1948, Arab league killed or displaced all Jews living in Jerusalem?

yes. all Jews that were in Gaza the west bank and in Jerusalem were displaced and or killed. Jerusalem was also put under siege.

9. If the people living in Gaza donât like Hamas, why they did not start a revolution to remove them from power? They have been elected no?

Hamas is an oppressive regime. it killed all of the Fatah members after it took power. a revolution seems bloody. even a protest that was economic in nature got brutally stopped. as to why Hamas was elected, Fatah is trash. everyone was dissatisfied with their corruption. and Hamas was the only other option. after Hamas took power they violently opposed anyone against them. and refused to hold elections. a revolution is definitely important. but most people wouldn't risk their families like that.

Hamas is not a governmental entity that can have an embassy anywhere. Hamas used to be a charity organization in the 1980s  that Israel funded and manoeuvred into power to be a counterweight to PLO and give Israel an excuse to not negotiate a peace settlement.

&gt;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Israelâs regular allowing of Qatari funds to be transferred into Gaza, saying it is part of a broader strategy to keep Hamas and the Palestinian Authority separate, a source in Mondayâs Likud faction meeting said.

&gt;The prime minister also said that âwhoever is against a Palestinian state should be forâ transferring the funds to Gaza, because maintaining a separation between the PA in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza helps prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.

https://m.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/netanyahu-money-to-hamas-part-of-strategy-to-keep-palestinians-divided-583082


&gt;For years, the various governments led by Benjamin Netanyahu took an approach that divided power between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank â bringing Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to his knees while making moves that propped up the Hamas terror group.

&gt;The idea was to prevent Abbas â or anyone else in the Palestinian Authorityâs West Bank government â from advancing toward the establishment of a Palestinian state.

&gt;Thus, amid this bid to impair Abbas, Hamas was upgraded from a mere terror group to an organization with which Israel held indirect negotiations via Egypt, and one that was allowed to receive infusions of cash from abroad.

Fighting for the release of your own people or simply defending against genocidal terrorists who kills innocents is far from a genocide. ProPalestinians call it a genocide to paint Israel evil

1a) aid was never delayed by Israel itself, those are lies. There have been protests of Israelis whose family are in Hamas dungeons because Hamas gets most of the aid. Israel is obligated to get the aid to those who need it.

2) Hamas is mostly controlling Gaza but they are also spread around the West Bank with many other terrorists who all have the same goal..
It is a war

3) They are not ""claimed"" to be terrorists, they are terrorists. They invaded Israel shot and burned anything alive...
There had been attempt in 2005 when Israel pulled out of Gaza and let them have democratic elections in which they elected Hamas who is a terrorist organization.
Instead of making Gaza a heaven, they made it a huge terror city with the goal of one day ""destroying"" Israel

4) There was never a state called Palestine, the area was simply called Palestina, Jews and Arabs have lived there together for a while.
Jews were living in this area for more than 2000 years until they were banished. It is our ancestral homeland, we came here because we saw 80 years ago what happened to us when we have country to call home, we can still see it clear as day to this day.

5) I don't know enough about that yet, but so far the IDF has admitted its mistake, that would not have happened if Hamas weren't hiding inbetween their own people or if they didn't use every civil tool/infrastructue in their disposal to disguise/hide themselves against the IDF

6) I'm not sure what you mean by lenient, most countries are against Israel and simply because they believe every lie a terrorist organization says,
If you're talking about the 3 hostages, it was a mistake,
Hamas uses everything like i said, kids, babies as shields, they fake surrender then blow themselves up... the simple answer is:
It is a battlefield.. a lot of things happen in the midst of a battle and mistakes happen,
The only reason Israel is fighting Gaza right now is to free its own people

1320,"Here are some of their volunteers and claims:
1.	Yossi Landau:

Heâs the head of operations for the southern region at ZAKA, a senior official, and is behind a lot of the debunked lies, with him admitting one to be false just recently. Heâs behind some of the most sensationalist, parroted â and debunked claims. He also âconfirmedâ, not one, but âdozens of beheaded babiesâ, the now widely mocked lie. Another lie he reported was about the piles of childrenâs bodies burned together, a narrative that he repeated time and again, likening it to the Holocaust.

One of the most popular and widely echoed lies of his that was uncritically yelled by the  estern media, was him finding a pregnant woman in Kibbutz Beâeri in a âbig puddle of blood, face down.â âHer stomach was butchered open,â Landau said while crying profusely in front of western reporters, âThe baby that was connected to the cord was stabbed. And the mother was shot in the head. And you use your imagination, trying to figure out what came first.â

This is now a widely agreed upon hoax even by rabid zionist media, it was so widely debunked that even he had to come out and admit it to maintain their credibility, which is in fact something that âIsraelâ did in Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon against Palestinians and Shia Lebanese, and has now become a text book example of atrocity propaganda. There were only 2 female victims in or around Beâeri and none were pregnant, in all of Oct 7 operations in fact, and Beâeri itself denied these claims.


Yossi Landau, a trusted witness for NYT also said, âWhen we go into a house, we use our imagination,â when describing the groupâs work at the October 7 attack sites. âThe bodies were telling us what happened, thatâs what happened.â

Nothing else is to be expected from an ultra-orthodox wahhabi like extremist fraud group, who arenât even trained in any medical testing due to their extremist beliefs, whose real job is to give emotionally charged speeches to a western audience to spread propaganda for the settler state.

Another thing he lies about is that he tells the infamous NYT piece âscreams without wordsâ that he didnât take pictures as they arenât allowed to due to their extremist wahhabi like ultra orthodox views, yet he insists to Al Jazeeraâs skeptical Richard Sanders â who had asked him about the dead fetus story (now shredded) â that âif you want to see the picture, I have the picture.â. He then refuses to show the picture but instead shows a video where Sanders pointed out that there are no babies. Only used to being valorized and coddled by the genocidal western media, Landau then splutters through a series of contradictory excuses: âYou canât see the baby because â but this is the picture of the mother. For sure. You know, we didnât think, when we â we didnât think to to, to camera everything. We didnât have that, this wasnât in ourâ¦.â

That isnât it. He also proclaimed in a podcast on 3rd December that anyone who questions their reports and doesnât believe their pathetic jokes âshould be together with the Hamas terrorists, and he should be killed.â

Even the âIsraeliâ presidentâs wife shared it in an op-ed for Newsweek, which is still up.

2.	Simcha Dizingoff

Hes ZAKAâs deputy commander who spouted off a few made-for-foreign-media-consumption stories of his own. Describing an October 11 visit to Kfar Aza, he told The Guardian that he saw âa woman, naked from the waist down, [who] had been bent over a bed and then shot in the back of the head. When the team tried to move her, a live grenade rolled out of her clenched hand.â

âIsraelâ had already cleared the kibbutz by oct 11, and none of this was mentioned by anyone, even the notoriously shady âIsraelâ commission report by cochav elkayam-levy. He runs his imagination even more and says he saw a 6 y/o child with a knife plunged in his skull. The official death records of Kfar Aza reject this.

3.	Simcha Greiniman, Zakaâs deputy commander, and, Chaim (or Haim) Otmazgin:

He claimed naked women were tied to trees at the Supernova music festival. He said he found a toddler with a knife stuck through his head and that he discovered foreign fighters â they had left their Ids in their pockets, which is rejected by âIsraeliâ account itself says that only one infant was killed, not that it was ever backed by anything.

https://theintercept.com/2024/02/27/zaka-october-7-israel-hamas-new-york-times/ 

Greinimanâs main profession is carpentry, but he takes pride in his media performance: âThey say I do a good job. When I sit in front of a foreign journalist, even if he is anti-âIsraelâ, I can make him cry,â Greiniman told Ynet.

Hereâs another bombshell:

[Otmazgin is also a rape supporter who was one of chief public defenders of the serial rapist that led ZAKA, Meshi-Zahav, who was dubbed the âJeffrey Epstein of âIsraelââ. He even told the âIsraeliâ army radio that Meshi-Zahav was in fact a victim of blackmail by his accusers, and the last thing he is capable of doing is hurting others.](https://mondoweiss.net/2023/12/zaka-is-not-a-trustworthy-source-for-allegations-of-sexual-violence-on-october-7/)

Hamas terrorists didnât just murder these people, they brutalized them. Women were found with their hips broken from being assaulted so many times. Womenâs genatelia was brutalized including literally cutting off their breasts. Peopleâs fingers were cut off. 

Hamas has also said they will do the attack again and their goal is NOT palestinian peace, their goal is the murder of all Jews. If they cared about Palestinians, they wouldnât operate inside of hospitals.

My problem with the whole ""humanitarian aid"" thing isn't necessarily that it goes in. It's that there are hundreds of tons of aid going in **on a daily basis**, but because Hamas seizes it in order to use it as a leverage, the west believes that nothing goes on.

The price of a sack of flour from UNRWA weighing 5kg(that is supposed to be given for free and not sold) was around 1000 shekel at the start of the war.

Around the time that Israel took over the Rafah crossing, ie Hamas' lifeline, it ""magically"" dropped to 20-50 shekel.

Definition of genocide= acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.
The Hamas supporters have been falsely calling this a genocide since the day Israel went into Gaza. 

35,000 people dead, more than half are militant Hamas soldiers, 4,959 women and 7,797 children out of a population of 2.1 million people. This is not genocide, this is a war, and one with a 1:1 combatant:civilian death ratio. Extremely low civilian death ratio for any war, let alone one in a dense urban zone where militants wear civilian clothes, hide among civilians in their midst, in tunnels underneath them &amp; refusing to provide shelters to their population. 

Calling it a genocide is false, offensive and blatantly wrong.

The modern-day Jewish state was created after the Nazis committed the genocide known as the Holocaust, murdering six million Jews. Rwanda was a genocide. Cambodia was a genocide. This is not. 

The implied hypocrisy that survivors of genocide, the Jewish people, are now committing one of their own makes for a powerful talking point in the war of words surrounding the conflict between Israel and Gaza. But no one should twist the truth simply to bolster a political agenda. 

Charging Israel with genocide gives a free pass to the Hamas terrorists who are deliberately engineering the immense harm that innocent Palestinians are experiencing today.

Hamasâs goal is to wipe the Jewish people off the map. October 7th was a manifestation of that goal and Hamas representatives have recently reiterated that they will never stop pursuing it. Thatâs an example of genocidal intent. 

Israel has a right to defend itself within the bounds of international conventions and law from the thousands of Hamas missiles that have been fired on Israeli towns and cities for nearly 20 years before and since October 7. Those missiles donât originate from military bases, as international law dictates. They are fired from civilian neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip, and from inside, next to, and underneath nominally civilian areas in Gaza like residential buildings, schools, mosques, and hospitals.

1347,"I just want to prepare you that the ICC's case is entirely predicated on Israel restricting aid to Gaza purportedly to stave the population and commit ""extermination.""  Israel is going to demonstrate that they let far more food into Gaza during the time period than necessary to feed the population and will potentially also show that Hamas stole most if not all of it for their own needs and to sell back to the people.

At that point, the ICC is going to be in a very difficult position of either having to:  (1) conclude that Hamas is responsible for any famine instead of Israel; (2) conclude there never was any famine and the entire charge was baseless; or (3) hold Israel responsible despite Hamas being the proximate cause of any famine.  Those are all bad options.

This is particularly problematic for the ICC given that they've decided to charge the democratically elected leader of a western democracy with literal war crimes for restricting supplies to a country (all of the ICC's jurisdiction is based on Gaza being a country) that had just attacked them.  I want you to think about that--the ICC believes that Israel had an obligation to supply food, water, electricity, and medical supplies to a foreign state that had just started a war with them and that it was a literal war crime not to.  No country in history has ever been held to that standard.

It's also worth noting that Israel did not control the border between Egypt and Gaza until about a week ago, and so if there was a shortage then Egypt could have supplied Gaza with all it needed over that crossing.  Except it didn't.  But... for some reason... Egypt isn't named in the ICC charge.  Worse, the minute Israel took control of the crossing, Egypt shut it down on the basis that it should be run by Palestinians.  So Egypt shut down all crossings into Rafah during an alleged famine because they didn't like who controlled the crossing, and the ICC doesn't have a damn thing to say about it.

Israel took action in Gaza because of Hamas, Oct 7th and the threat to more of its citizens due to rockets, additional Oct 7th style attacks and because Hamas wants to genocide Jews and Israelis. What is happening in Gaza is not remotely close to Bosnia. As evident by the ground invasion, Israel doesn't target civilians. The bombings were necessary to target infrastructure that Hamas uses to launch rockets, to destroy weapon caches, and to target Hamas terrorists, all of these targets were housed in civilian infrastructure, which under international law are all legitimate targets as long as warnings and attempts to minimize (not eliminate) civilian casualties are taken. Did you know that if an enemy stores military equipment or if they use the civilian population as human shields, both are considered war crimes, so it rape as a form of terror (seems its Hamas committing the war crimes, not Israel).

The Ugarit would become a precursor to Canaanite culture?

Second millenium BC, Egyptian records mention the Peleset in the Levant.

Judaism is founded presumably around the 9th century BC in the Babylonian ""Ur of Chaldes"", believed to be in modern Iraq.

The hebrew tribe wandered over the mountains to the Levant to invade and conquer northern Canaan, forming various hebrew kingdoms, which would exist as a vassal under the rule of whatever the ruling empire of the day was, Babylon, Assyria, Egypt, Rome, until around 2,000 years ago, presumably Rome was clamping down during it's occupation of the Levant, Rome was persecuting the natives, robbing them of their home, their lands, their property, persecuting and oppressing them, murdering them, they were terrible, monsters.

The occupied israelites launched a series of terrorist campaigns and revolts, israelite zealot terrorist groups formed as well as the sicarii terrorists of the terror fortress of Masada.

As the israelites resisted the oppression of their occupiesrs, turning to violent terrorism to resist the theft of their land, the oppression of their people, the disregard of their civil rights, being treated like their needs came second to the needs of Romans, the Canaan land they had invaded and conquered had come under the rule of the Romans, the the Romans ruled it in a way where Roman interests came first.

Roman occupied levant became a Roman ethnostate dedicated to Roman citizens.  The Roman occupation would rob the israelites of their homes and land and give it to foreign Roman citizens, coming from outside the Levant to new roman settlements built for Roman citizens, to further the Roman occupations goal of providing benefits for Roman citizens at the expense of the occupied peoples.

israelites that protested and resisted the Roman occupation were brutally suppressed, some even murdered by the Roman occupation.

As israelite violent terrorism rose, the Roman occupation cracked down harder and harder on the now terrorist israelite population.

After numerous israelite terrorist revolts, Rome finally crushed the israelite rebellions, conquering the terrorist fortress of Masada, and driving the rebel israelites out, finally winning Roman peace for the Roman citizens of Roman Palestine.

At last, Rome found peace in the troubled middle east.  Having stolen more and more land from the natives decade by decade, facing near endless resistance and terrorism, Rome finally found peace through violent action.

10th century AD: Palestinians start self-identifying as Palestinians

1834, Palestinian Peasants revolt in Ottoman Palestine, successfully revolting from the Ottoman occupation.  Years later, the Ottoman Empire would retake Palestine.

World war 1: The allies approach the Arabs of the OE, promising them independence if they revolt against the OE.  The Arabs revolt.

For years it's agreed by all parties, british included, that Palestine is in the areas guaranteed Arab independence.  The british retroactively change their position on this years later.

In August 1920, Sir Herbert Samuel, the British official controlling the Palestine region asks to extend his administrative control east of the river Jordan, this request is denied.  Trans-Jordan remains separate and independent.

British foreign secretary Lord Curzon decides British policy for Trans-Jordan, considered to be ungovernable nomadic-tribal desert, will be to encourage self-governance.  The British government assured the local population that Britain guaranteed their independence.

November 21st 1920, Abdullah Al-Hussein declares independence, supported by the British government.  Trans-Jordans government is officially recognized by the British government on April 11 1921.

Also 1920, March 1 1920, foreign zionists twice attack native Palestinians.

&gt;comprising also the current state of Jordanâcame into existence in 1923. Until that time, the Arabs living there saw themselves primarily not as âPalestiniansâ in the sense of a nationhood but as Arabs living in Palestine

Interestingly you simultaneously deny Palestinian self-identity when it suits your personal narrative, you thrust the Palestinian self-identity you claim doesn't exist on Trans-Jordan...

Identity at this time is a rather tricky thing, native Christians, for instance, often self-identify as Assyrian as an example.

I don't know of any reliable source that supports your claim that Jordanians at this time identified as Palestinians, though the more important thing seems to be the false propaganda pushed by zionists that somehow Jaffa and Haifa native Palestinians are somehow more native to Amman than they are to Palestine, which is, of all zionists wildly insane ideas, one of zionists most insane ideas.  Being one of zionists most insane ideas is quite an amazing accomplishment.

In 1945, the european terrorist militias including Haganah launched ""Plan aleph"", the first step in their foreign terrorist revolt.

April 9th 1948, as part of the subsequent ""Plan dalet"" the terrorist haganah and irgun, the political arm of which was herut, now Likud, would carry out the Deir Yassin massacre, note April 9th 1948 is famous for coming over a month before May 14th 1948...

When October 7 happened and you were on social media it felt like the whole world cheered for the murder of innocent Israelis, everyone was quick to jump on to say that the beheadings and rapes are fake although we saw the videos with our own eyes, Hamas and other groups posted it themselves and they were proud of it. They didnât even grief their dead while they saw videos and posts of people worldwide celebrating the massacre. It hurts. They feel like nobody saw their pain and I felt like that too to be honest.

Now pictures of the baby in Rafah come out and itâs horrible no questions asked, thereâs nothing that justifies that. What Israelis feel is that nobody cared about Israeli beheaded children on October 7, people even tried to gaslight them that it didnât happen and that hurts.

A big problem is that I think people from the global north â â and I am not one of those â â still retain this instinctive western bias that all people are liberal rationalists. So, for example, they will by default just assume that the ""radicals"" in any given population, like Gaza or Muslims in New York, MUST be in the minority. But is there actually any evidence of that?

Where exactly are the Gazan people who did not commit rape/murder AND did not condone rape/murder?

Let's just take the rape question.

Online you can find the videos that the Hamas terrorists posted of themselves, returning to Gaza, with naked, beaten, and likely raped women...who had just been murdered or might just about to be murdered.

Here is one. A Jewish woman is cowering, obviously, raped, about to be killed in her last moments, she is hearing people jeering at her torn, naked flesh.

https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/s/x76uj6FeQr

In the other videos you can see the people of Gaza cheering, laughing, taunting, just having a really wonderful happy moment. 

MORE important you do NOT see anyone speaking up.

You do not see any religious leaders, business leaders, humanitarian leaders, anyone at all speaking up and saying ""wait, stop, this is not our cause"" or ""not in our name!""

Do you honestly think that that could happen publicly anywhere else in the world and NOBODY speak up? 

You have to stop this ridiculous line of distinguishing between the ordinary Palestinians (adults) and Hamas.

As I said it's racist to say ""Hamas does not represent the ordinary Gazan."" What you are saying is that ""I, as a white Westerner, think this way, and so all people in the world must think as I do.""

By the way, I am not a white westerner and I can tell you not everybody in the world thinks exactly like white Westerners.

No, different people in different parts of the world may hold completely different values for political, religious, cultural, or many other reasons.

It feels odd that I have to spell this out but obviously it is a widespread assumption, especially in the left-wing intellectual circles in the west, that all people are moderate in the majority and radicals are only in the minority.

Yet...we have no evidence that, for example, anyone in Gaza opposed rape of Jewish women.

I'm glad to hear that the kings of Oman or Bahrain or a Saudi Minister opposed it -- weeks later.

But apparently nobody in Gaza opposed it, and from what we're seeing on the streets of London and Toronto, millions of white leftists and Palestinians/Arabs are perfectly fine with the mass rape of women.

Most recently we learned:

-Hostages have been farmed out to elements within the Gaza population

-One of the hostages escaped, and then was captured by ordinary Gaza citizens, and returned to the terrorists.

-Gazans stoning hostage RC bus

-it is now coming out how the hostages were treated terribly, not just by their ""captors"" but everyone came into contact with

-we even though now that some of the hostages were kept with UN employees--so even the UN employee Gazans were pro Hamas

Finally, we have very simple public opinion poll data. I mean I assume it must be very difficult to actually do these polls, but they always show overwhelming support for terrorism and they certainly show right now on the West Bank and Gaza overwhelming support for October 7.

Again, prove this wrong without resorting to waving hands in the air and stating a variation of ""all the people of Gaza are just like me.""

""You are being racist."" You say? ""You are trying to say that the Gazans are monsters.""

No, it is the western leftists and pseudo-intellectuals and useful idiots who are saying that the Gazans cannot hold an opinion that you don't approve of.

I have no will currently to go back literal years of telegram posts to find pictures of the Gaza strip, but it's not this person with huge towering walls and guards in every corner, ready to shoot anyone.

There are places that are more fortified than others, just like the wall in Judea and Samaria. But what Egypt have built in their part of Rafah crossing is exactly what you might think of as ""prison"".

&gt;with virtually no rights?

What rights? Are they Israeli citizens? Do they have Israeli ID cards and are part of the Israeli population?

No they are not. Since the Oslo Accords, Gazans were under the responsibility of Ramallah, not Jerusalem. Try sharing your grievances with Abbas, maybe he will care enough to do something.

&gt;What would you do if the country that is imprisoning you said you will never have rights?

As my previous answer, Gaza is not a prison. People could leave it, and have left through Egypt. To Turkey, Europe or even the US.

In the years before the war, there were some 20,000 Gazans working in Israel making Hamas millions in taxes and providing food for hundreds of families. Yet I won't be surprised if a part of those participated in the massacares, rapes and kidnappings.

&gt;What would you do if 100s of thousands of your brothers and sisters had their land violently stolen in the West Bank?

Has there been violent takeover of land? 100% such things happened.

Have there been lands that were appropriated by the state? 100% such things happened.

But look further into *how most* of the land was acquired, and you'll see that a lot of the land has been purchased, or it was settled because it was a swamp, a desert, or no one worked it or used it as grazing grounds.

&gt;Peace is the only answer and that will never be achieved until Palestinians have security and full human rights.

Their governments and representatives are responsible for their security and rights. Not Israel. And that is *our* problem.

1380,"Hey! I agree that ""nobody"" would be a hyperbole, which is why I added an exception. But I think some bigger disconnects are going on here, perhaps between our beliefs as a whole.

To your point -- I think there is a disconnect between intent/meaning and perception here. Free Palestine protesters say ""from the river to the sea, palestine will be free"" because Palestinians lack freedoms *all* across the region: in the West Bank, Israel proper, and Gaza. Thus, we quite literally hope that from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, all Palestinians in that region will be granted equal freedoms/rights/protections that Israelis have. I have heard some Israelis say that they feel the statement is anti-Semitic, but that is simply a false perception, which (I believe) stems from valid fear. Nowhere in the statement does it say Israel should not exist; in fact, most people say that statement with a 2SS in mind. Furthermore, historically, the statement has been used with a strictly peaceful connotation. 

There are many cases when effect trumps intent. For example, if you unknowingly insult someone's intelligence. No matter what you meant, the effect was hurtful and is worth apologizing for. In this case though, not only is the slogan not inherently hurtful, but it is ***not even antithetical*** to the Israeli cause. It is not ""from the river to the sea, israel will end"" lol. The fact that Israelis take issue with the statement goes back to what I mentioned in my first post: ""Rights for one group does not equate to less rights for another group.""

To your second point, I agree that I do not know better than Palestinians what they want at all. This is why, many of my beliefs are directly informed by some amazing conversations I have had directly with Palestinian refugees. That includes dismantling the military occupation in the West Bank, ending the blockade in Gaza, and creating a long-term 1SS/2SS.

On the point of the blockade, Egypt and Jordan may be participants in the blockade, but their impact is not nearly the same. Gaza is a settlement *within* the Israeli border.

As one example?

Do you hold the Roman conquest of the israelites to the same standards you hold the violent foreign zionist terrorist conquest of Palestine in the 1917-1949 timeframe?

Would you accept the Roman conquest of the kingdom of israel on the grounds that the kingdom of israel didn't qualify for whatever arbitrary reasons you have, whatever they are?

1386,"If Israel is occupying Palestinian land, can you please explain in the basis of international law for Palestinian ownership of this land?

Answer:
They all likely assume that there was a previous Palestinian state, that the Israelis occupied and destroyed, but in reality, there has never been a Palestinian state of any kind, ever, at any point in world history. 
Thereâs been a region known as Palestine since 134 A.D., when the Romans applied the name to the land that had previously been known as Judea, that is, the land of the Jews. 
In fact, the Jews used to be called the Palestinians, but, Arafat stole that. Palestine was akin to Staten Island. It was only the name of a region, never of a people or a nation.
By the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottoman Empire had sovereignty over the territory that is now Israel, and supposedly occupied land as well. The Ottoman Empire was, however, known by this time as âthe sick man of Europeâ. In the early 1920s, just before the empire fell altogether, it conceded control of Palestine, and the land that came to be known as Transjordan. They ceded Jordan to the League of Nations. Jordan is 100 years old. Thatâs it. 
On July 24, 1922, The League of Nations granted administrative control over these territories to Britain with the specific instructions: to create âa national home for the Jewish people â. 
Britain immediately turned over 77% of the mandate to the Arabs to create Jordan, but remained generally committed to establishing a Jewish national home in the remainder. This was known as the Mandate for Palestine.  
Sometimes leftists point to it as the Palestinian State that supposedly pre-dated Israel, but this claim relies on the ignorance of the fact that this British territory had been explicitly set aside for a Jewish settlement.
Nine years before the founding of the modern state of Israel, a 1939 flag of Palestine sports the Star of David.
When the state of Israel was founded in 1948, it immediately had to fight a war for its survival against the surrounding Arab nations that had vowed to destroy it. Then there was finally an occupation, in fact, two. Egypt occupied Gaza, and Jordan occupied Judea and Samaria, which are renamed the West Bank, which is why many people refuse to call it the West Bank today. Israel won back these territories in the six day war in 1967, but that was actually ending an occupation, not starting one. Israel was occupied.
The early international law governing sovereignty over these territories stipulated that they were to be part of a national home for the Jewish people. So, from whom was the land stolen? Not from the Ottomans, who had ceded it to the League of Nations. Not from the League, which had granted administrative power over it to the British. Not from the British, who only had it in order to create a Jewish state there. Not from the Palestinians, who didnât even exist until the 1960s, when the KGB and Yasser Arafat bestowed Palestinian nationality upon a group of Levantine Arabs, as a rhetorical weapon to use against Israel.
And it worked beautifully.
The idea that Israel is occupying Palestinian land was furthered in the 1990s by the Oslo accords, to which Israel unwisely acceded, and in which it agreed to work towards the establishment of a Palestinian state in so-called West Bank and Gaza, which would only become a new base for more jihadist attacks.
But a Palestinian state, if ever created, would be the first ever in history. Period. There is no Israel occupation. 
In fact, itâs Israel that is occupied.

* they could not locate a single rape victim
* not a single rape or sexual assault was caught on any of the thousands of hours of security camera footage and captured Hamas videos
* none of the video and photographic evidence of the dead conclusively demonstrate rape or deliberate mutilation
  - a small number of the dead are *suggestive* of *possible* rape
* there is no evidence that the Hamas forces were under instruction to commit systematic rape

Blinken comment for the ICC-

Strong statement from Secretary of State Tony Blinken slamming ICC re: pursuit of Bibi/Gallant arrest warrants:

""The United States fundamentally rejects the announcement today from the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) that he is applying for arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials, together with warrants for Hamas terrorists.

We reject the Prosecutorâs equivalence of Israel with Hamas. It is shameful. Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that carried out the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and is still holding dozens of innocent people hostage, including Americans.

Moreover, the United States has been clear since well before the current conflict that that ICC has no jurisdiction over this matter. The ICC was established by its state parties as a court of limited jurisdiction. Those limits are rooted in principles of complementarity, which do not appear to have been applied here amid the Prosecutorâs rush to seek these arrest warrants rather than allowing the Israeli legal system a full and timely opportunity to proceed. 

In other situations, the Prosecutor deferred to national investigations and worked with states to allow them time to investigate. The Prosecutor did not afford the same opportunity to Israel, which has ongoing investigations into allegations against its personnel.

There are also deeply troubling process questions. Despite not being a member of the court, Israel was prepared to cooperate with the Prosecutor. In fact, the Prosecutor himself was scheduled to visit Israel as early as next week to discuss the investigation and hear from the Israeli Government. 

The Prosecutorâs staff was supposed to land in Israel today to coordinate the visit. Israel was informed that they did not board their flight around the same time that the Prosecutor went on cable television to announce the charges. These and other circumstances call into question the legitimacy and credibility of this investigation.

Fundamentally, this decision does nothing to help, and could jeopardize, ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement that would get hostages out and surge humanitarian assistance in, which are the goals the United States continues to pursue relentlessly""",1/15/2024 23:36,Pro-Israel

But wait a minute! 

Neither side had actual control over Gaza. The PLO was being slowly kicked out from Gaza by none other than the âIslamic resistance movementâ (aka by its Arabic acronym Hamas). By 2007, two years BEFORE the conclusion of negotiations, Hamas had total control over Gaza. 

How can two countries negotiate over a territory neither one holds?

1455,"&gt;3- Those who say that in 1880, when the first wave of modern Jewish emigration began, there was a Palestinian people and nation that was displaced by the Zionist invasion, are promoters of Palestinian extremist mythology that has no historical basis to support it.

By that logic, the Europeans who came onto the shores of the New World weren't actually displacing the Native Americans, because the was no such thing as a Native American people, nation or country back then, right?

They just came and settled on uninhabited land not owned by Native Americans, right? White settlers who ventured off into the wild and settled on uninhabited land. I guess the Native Americans were the bad guys then? In fact, because some Native American tribes were nomads and moved from place to place, does this mean they never owned any land legally?

**According to you, there was no such thing as the ethnic cleansing or expulsion of Native Americans because there was no such thing as a Native American people, nation or country prior to European colonization.**

This is exact same argument used to justify colonialism of the new world, that because the Native Americans never unified, never formed a nation and country prior to the European arrival, this somehow justifies taking their land?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Hamasic song ""from the River to the Sea to Palestine will be free"" is the song of the true land thieves, or, alternatively, ignorant ones, who only want to destroy Israel. Rather, the phrase ""Free Palestine"" is a code name for ""Destruction of Israel."" Whoever wants to steal land from its true owners in this conflict is, without a doubt, the terrorist movement Hamas .

Ignoring the fact the current Israeli governing party, Likud, literally uses the same phrase of ""From the river to the sea"" for Israel not Palestine in their 1977 charter. Why when an Israeli party, mind you the current government of Israel, uses the exact same phrase, it's not genocide and advocating the total destruction of Palestine then? While when a Palestinian uses it, it's considered terrorism, land thieves and genocide? Quote:

***""between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.""***

Netanyahu's stance is pretty clear. Destroy Hamas' military capabilities. Make sure that a Hamas equivalent doesn't replace them, and this will  a require military occupation paired with an alliance of Israel appointed nations to oversee the future of Gaza.  Hostages are a priority (that's why Israel has made generous ceasefire offers to Hamas) but ceasefire negotiations are basically dead at this point.  Which is absurd given that Hamas is in no position to make demands. The IDF has killed &gt;13k Hamas terrorists in 6 months. Thousands more aren't fit for combat. Hamas' total fighting force is 30-40k terrorists. And Rafah has the 4/5 of the last Battalions. Probably 10k strength.

1465,"let me start off by saying that Zionism is evil, and the zionist army has no right to exist nor to conduct ongoing military operations.

That being said, Hamas terrorism is also evil. Holding hostages is evil. Murdering civilians is evil.

The total population, men women and children, is guilty if they are not calling out the evil of hamas. And, I don't mean lip service. Your people should not have any tolerance for violent terrorists in your midst. there should be unfortunate storried of anti-hamasniks getting killed by hamas as traitors, and your community is very unfortunately) morally obligated to risk life and limb to stop evil  hamas. If the Gazan social fabric doesn't have that, the whole community becomes guilty and complicit in this evil violent destructive war.

Let me be very clear, this is not a call for any violence towards Gazans, nor is this even a call for external judgment against the  Gazan people. The Gazans might be completely anti-terrorism and innocent victims of Zionism and Hamas. On the other hand, their guilt is not a green light for zionist to attack.

It's a lose-lose situation, and everyone is morally obligated to do the right thing.

What I see is that within the borders of the Zionist state there are many outspoken anti-zionists (like myself), from the intense and widespread rejection of Zionism by the Jewish religion and the near 18% of jews who call themselves ""charedi"" as well as the masses of irreligious leftist who have worked hard to promote peaceful coexistence with palestinians.

I don't believe the anti-zionist voices within the Jewish community are enough, nor does it excuse the evil actions and evil racism of colonial zionism. But, there is a social fabric of disgust and rejection for Jewish terrorism by anyone and especially by the IDF. Calls for genocide are rejected by an anti-zionist public, despite the murderous actions of their army. Again, not enough, but it's meaningful

Compare that to , and maybe this is because of media bias and propaganda, the radio silence by Gazans to scream for the release of the hamas hostages. where are the widespread rally's to dismantle hamas or at least submit themselves to the demands of the evil zionists to stop this current war? why are international pro-palestinian marches outspoken (rightfully) to destroy the Zionist state but not also outspoken against violent resistance and hostage taking?",12/1/2023 5:34,Neutral

For instance, the overwhelming sense from the Israeli government itself is one of betrayal, both over the idea that Hamas agreed to a deal amid negotiations that the U.S. were a party to without Israel being present and, of course, the actual withholding of weapons in response to the Rafah offensive.Â 

There are conflicting views, however, which speak to Israelâs dynamic democratic society. One former senior official I spoke with today felt Prime Minister Netanyahu was to blame for opening the Rafah offensive before sending diplomats to Cairo, knowing the U.S. had warned against the move (whether or not the limited nature of the Rafah offensive crossed President Bidenâs stated âred lineâ is officially under review by the White House, but I think itâs clear they did not welcome the operation).Â 

Whatâs clear I would say is that this is a critical juncture for the longstanding U.S.-Israel alliance. Prime Minister Netanyahu has made clear he would fight this war alone if need be, but I would say the vast majority of Israeli officials I speak with are generally eager to try to find a path to mend the cracks that have emerged between the U.S. and Israel, knowing the key role that U.S. support plays for Israel, and will continue to play even beyond this conflict.Â ",11/29/2023 21:27,Neutral

During the naqba, nazi Jews murdered 10 of thousands of innocent Palestinians women and children forcing them out of there homes that they've lived in for generations, then hurded them to Gaza strip where they were locked in and blockaded. There, the nazi Jew government implemented a system of apartheid all across Israel and didn't allow food, water, or electricity in the concentration camp, starving people to death. After decades of this treatment, a group was created within the walls of the concentration camp to resist apartheid and slavery. That group was Hamas.
